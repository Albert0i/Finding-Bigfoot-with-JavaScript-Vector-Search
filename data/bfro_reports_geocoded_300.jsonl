{"id":"8000","observed":"Hello, My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe. My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I'm guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard. This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization. We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. \"Wrong\" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn't just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being \"up off the ground some ways\" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I've read on this website, it's virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that's what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.","classification":"Class B","county":"York","state":"Pennsylvania","locationDetails":"I would rather not have exact location (listing the nearest road) to repect the privacy of the family that still owns the property. I have long since had a falling out with my friend at the time and don't feel he or they would like being approache about this. I like my own privacy respected; so I must accord others the same. The general area at that time was more open farmland with some large housing developements (in which I lived) within a mile. There were a good deal of homes scattered here and there and others in smaller developments. A very large animal like a Sasquatch could conceivably navigate (migrate) through an area like this at night using farmland as cover; but absolutely not stay very long in an area like that even then without revealing it's presense. I can give you more specific details on topography. Farmland opens up eventually much more to the north with a State Park (Gifford Pinchot) at the north end of the county. Southern end of York county where the  sightings occurred is a more likely area given in terms of what I've read of similar topography of other sighting then. Also much more rural and forested in the early \"70's."}

Not a coyote, bear or cougar. Have heard all of them before. This was nothing like anything I have ever heard. I still remember thinking to myself \"How in the hell can something make such a low howl.\" It scared us at first, but is sounded like it was far away, like maybe a mile or so. We were drinking a little beer, so after awhile we relaxed and forgot about it. It must have been about a half hour later when we heard it again. I swear that it had to be within 30 yards of us. Same loud, low howl, but MUCH closer. And it sounded pissed. I could feel the sound vibrations bouncing off the back of my neck. The hair stood up on the back of all of our necks. All of us turned white as hell, and our jaws dropped past our knees. The howl seemed to say \"GET OUT!\" Which is EXACTLY what we did. I just looked at the two other guys and said \"lets get the @#$ outta here \". We did not see anything, but felt the presence. I grew up within 10 miles of that spot. I had never heard that sound before, or since, EXCEPT on a television show that had a report of a bigfoot sighting. A guy in Idaho caught one on video (at least it looked like one), but when I saw the video, I heard that scream again. The guy taking the video threw the camera in the ditch, and hid. It was the SAME scream. ONLY other time that I have EVER heard it. It was EXACTLY the same scream. I saw this video on a news show, something like \"Real TV\" while in Fairfax, VA, in 1992 or 1993. I do not know EXACTLY what it is that we heard, but I know what I think it was. Bigfoot.

We were living in an old farmhouse on approx. 77 acres of woods & creeks near Lake Ontario. This incident happened sometime between the 18th-20th of September. My sister's birthday is the 20th and I recall a small group of family and friends were visiting the house for that occasion. My future-stepfather took a small group, including his brother, my four sisters, and a few other friends out for a \"tour\" of the property. I was not present, I had stayed behind at the house. As the group returned to the house, my stepfather lingered behind in an area of the property where a strip of woods runs between two fields. My stepfather was in the field closer to the house, we'll refer to it as field #1. He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods. He ran ahead and told his brother, but did not tell the rest of the group. His brother rushed into the house to get me, telling me that something was in the woods and I should come see. I followed him outside where my stepfather relayed the story to me and the three of us walked back to the area of his sighting. As my stepfather showed me the spot where the creature had been standing, we all noticed that the creature was still present, but had moved further back, to field #2. At this point, the three of us were standing in field 1 and looking through a small strip of trees at the creature in field 2, maybe 200 yards away or so. My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape. It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been. The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc. to get a better look at us. After approximately 45 seconds, the creature retreated to an area where we couldn't see it clearly. I walked through the trees into field 2 to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared. The area where it had been walking was matted down, but there were no distinct prints. Judging by nearby trees, I estimated its height to be 6.5 - 7 feet.","classification":"Class A","county":"Wayne","state":"New York","latitude":43.27314,"longitude":-76.89331,"latlng":"-76.89331,43.27314","locationDetails":"East on Route 104, near town of Huron.","dewPoint":54.06,"humidity":0.75,"cloudCover":0.48,"moonPhase":0.81,"pressure":1020.75,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy until evening.","uvIndex":4,"visibility":9.53,"highTemp":67.62,"midTemp":58.16,"lowTemp":48.7,"precipitationIntensity":0.0006,"precipitationProbability":0.21,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":253,"windSpeed":8.73}
{"id":"5692","timestamp":20995200,"title":"Father and son hear vocalizations on Peavine Mt","observed":"I grew up in Northwestern Nevada along the California border in the foothills of the Sierra's.  My father was a geologist who preferred working and camping in areas that were as sparsely populated as possible.  Between 1970 and 1983 I had a number of encounters in Nevada, California, and Washington states.  I plan to submit them individually in chronological sequence so that I can provide as much detail for researchers as possible. This first encounter occured in 1970 on Peavine Mountain Northwest of Reno, Nevada.  I was ten at the time and tagging along with my father, who was hunting deer.  We were on the Western side of the mountain, close to the California border.  We were between two ridges crossing a meadow on the Western face of the East ridge.  It was about 3:30 PM and the sun was beginning to drop behind the trees on the Western ridge.  There were no clouds and it was still very bright in the meadow, but the shallow draw between the two ridges was heavily shadowed. As my father and I neared the center of the meadow we heard an extended call coming from the West.  We had lived in Kansas until I was eight and the call reminded me of the World War II air raid siren they used for tornado alerts where we used to live.  It began low and relatively quiet and rose in both pitch and volume as it progressed.  It lasted for about fifteen to twenty seconds before rapidly dropping off.  After about ten seconds the call was repeated.  It seemed to me that it was coming from the draw a couple of hundred yards West and downhill from us.  Unlike the tornado siren I was familiar with, it had a mellow, rather than harsh, or mechanical, quality to it. As the second call ended I asked my father what was making the noise.  Annoyed, he told me that it was just the siren from a fire tower and picked up his pace.  That seemed reasonable, and I began looking around at the surrounding high ground for the tower when the call sounded a third time.  It seemed to be coming from the draw and seemed to be moving away from us. I caught up with my father and, being a curious ten-year old, asked him in rapid succession where the tower was and if he smelled any smoke.  He replied that it was on the other side of the far ridge and that they were just testing the siren.  I told him I thought the call was coming from the draw and at that point was told to shut up.  As the call sounded a fourth time, even further away, my father listened to it and then decided to call it a day.  We walked to the jeep and drove home without further incident.","classification":"Class B","county":"Washoe","state":"Nevada","latitude":39.592,"longitude":-119.975,"latlng":"-119.975,39.592","locationDetails":"The Western face of Peavine Mountain, Northwest of Reno Nevada.","dewPoint":43.89,"humidity":0.42,"moonPhase":0.02,"pressure":1011.96,"weatherSummary":"Clear throughout the day.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":9.76,"highTemp":88.56,"midTemp":70.22,"lowTemp":51.88,"windBearing":197,"windSpeed":1.96}
{"id":"438","observed":"heh i kinda feel a little dumb that im reporting this but its bothering me so here goes.. bout a month ago i was with a friend and her son, we were hanging out at a camp ground by Allamuchy state park, in Warren county NJ. i think the camp ground was part of Stephens state park either way it was on the Musconetcong river. it was late in the day and we were just walking on the trials by the river. we figured since her son was gonna stay with her folks that evening we would come back later and spend the night at the camp ground. we went home and got together some gear, just sleeping bags and sleeping pads. we stopped at a store got some hotdogs and rolls and a gallon of water then headed to the camp site. it was about 10pm when we got to the camp site and i think we took spot 19. it was close to the road one of the last spots before ya hit the road maybe 50 yards or so. we made a fire in the metal fire ring and just sat around till about 1am, there were maybe 5 or 6 sites that were camped that night one was taken by some boy scouts. at about 1am my friend got in her sleeping bag next to the fire, i was still up drinking hot chocolate and stareing into the fire, about 20min or so later i got into my bag next to her and was lieing on my side looking into the woods. i wasnt comfortable and i laid awake for a good hour or so just thinking and listening to the sounds of the woods and the river that was 100yards tops away from me. then i heard a sound like someone was lightly banging a fork or something against a plate. i thought maybe a bear was snooping around looking for a free meal, this is bear country and we have a very healthy black bear population, but maybe 30 seconds after i heard the metalic sound i heard someone or something bang a branch against a tree 4 or 5 times in a row, i thought that the bear maybe was getting a little to close to someones camp site. then i again heard banging against a tree but this time it was a bout 100yards into the woods and not near any camping area that i had seen in the daylight. then the tree banging came from the first spot as if answering the other position. the first tree banger was what seemed to be on or near the road by the middle of the camp ground. that kinda made my mind wander i was wondering what was going on..and who is up making all this noise. about 10minutes later i looked into the woods which were slightly iluminated by my dieing fire and i saw what looked like a bear looking into my camp about 20 feet away from behind a tree. i saw just the shadowy outline of it. i could see its head and shoulders slowly move out from behind the tree look in and then move back behind the tree. ive seen bears do this before in the day light but never this close. then i closed my eyes waited a few seconds and opened them just to make sure i wasnt seeing things. but this whatever it was had difined shoulders and a rounded kinda pointy on top head, it didnt have and ears like you would see on a bear, nor the flat head of a bear and if it was a bear its front arms wouldnt have given it the squared off shoulders that i was seeing in the silloette of this figure. i got kinda scared for a few moments and didnt move a at all. i thought for a second about jumping up and yelling at it but i didnt want so get it mad at me or scare it. i closed my eyes and tried my hardest just to fall asleep. i dozed off finally and was awoken by my friend who was yelling at me for not putting the bag of hotdogs in the car before going to sleep. we had in the bag a apple and a orange, rolls and a unopend pack of hotdogs, i tied the bag with a simple knot like you would tigh your shoes the night before, but when i got up the only thing left where the bag was, was the orange just sitting there on the ground. my friend said somthing along the lines of wow a bear came and stole our hotdogs. i kinda was wondering what was going on so i decided to have a look around where i saw the figure the night before, i remembered that the shadowy figure was hiding behind the tree and i could see a branch just above its head maybe a foot or so higher than the top of the figure. it was puzzleing because that branch must have been 8 or 9 feet off the ground and black bears where i come from dont stand that tall on there hind feet. i didnt try to tell her what i heard or saw the night before because she wouldnt have belived me anyway, but ive spend lots of time in the back country and woods hunting, fishing, rock climbing, and backpacking. i know what bears look like up close as well as from a distance. and this wasnt a bear and to tall for a person. i didnt smell anything but i think i was up wind anyway and we were burning wood in the fire and all i could really smell was the fire anyway. the thing that really bothers me is the tree banging its was allmost like something was comunicating with something else. it also bothers me that something waited until it was sure that i was asleep before coming into camp. in which case it woulda been 6 or 7 feet from where we were sleeping in order to open the bag and have a look in it, then disguard the orange and take the rest bag and all. it wouldve had to make some sound if it just tore the bag opened. i looked around before we left to see if i could find any tracks or anything but the ground is was just to hard, there was a few game trails but i didnt look very far or spend alot of time looking. i looked on the internet and found this sight and was surprized to see other sitings in new jersey.","classification":"Class

This is the first of two possible encounters I have experienced over 22 years. The second occurred on November 10th in 2001. We had just finished lighting our 4th of July fireworks and were sitting around the patio talking and relaxing. There were probably 8 adults and 6 kids at my former InLaws farm house. It was around 11pm when a friend of ours jumped up from his chair screaming for everyone to look at the bean field across the highway from the house. As we all turned to look we noticed something very large walking West to East aproximately 300 yards into the feild. It was a fairly clear and the moon was very bright that night. The animal/creature walked at a very fast pace through the beans to a point behind a hill where we lost sight of it. I have hunted my entire life and have never seen anything like this before. It walked leaning slightly forward, swinging it's arms as it moved across the field. At the distance it was from us the only thing we could notice is the size. I had been target shooting earlier that day and had a fire arm in my truck. My brother InLaw and I decided to go see if we could get a closer look at it. My 4X4 Ford truck was a former security truck so it was equiped with spotlights. We enter the field and drove to a point where we could see the trail heading to the East which we began to follow in the truck. We came to a barbed wire fence where one could tell something had crossed the fence and headed off into a tree line some 50 to 75 yards from the fence. WE sat there for maybe five minutes scanning the tree line with the spotlights and noticed nothing. I don't know if it was fear or common sense but we looked at each other and decided that whatever tore up the ground around the fence was too close for us to be sitting out in the field looking around in the dark. I put the truck into reverse and backed the entire way back out to the highway. This area is close to an old military base which stored ammo and bombs during WWII. There are numerous under ground storage bunkers a couple miles south of this area. No one at the gathering ever mentioned or talked about it again.

Mitchell is the highest peak east of the Mississippi River at 6,684 feet, and as a result, the mountain gets heavy snowfalls well into March and sometimes April. There had been some heavy snowfall in the weeks preceding our drive, and there were some deep snowdrifts piled up alongside the road, although the road had only a dusting of light snow on its surface. Almost no one goes up on the mountain in the wintertime, and as I remember it, we had to skirt our way around a barricade to even get on the road to the summit. We reached the top of the mountain, then turned around to drive back down. About a half mile below the summit, we went around a sharp, left-hand turn, and our headlights hit the steep bank beside the road. In the snow on the bank we could see several deep impressions that led up the bank and into the woods. We got out and examined the marks, but it was dark and we couldn't tell much about them. The next day, we drove back up and looked at the marks in the daylight. The tracks, as we took them to be, were in deep snow, and we could see mud at the bottom of them and measured the depth of the snow at 18 inches.  In the two tracks closest the road, there were faint outlines that could have been toe marks, but there were no claw marks visible as with bear tracks. The prints were apparently made by a bipedal animal, and led up a steep bank and disappeared over the top of the bank about 75 yards up the slope.  The bank beside the road was extremely steep, and it took my friend, who is 6-2 and athletic, eight long strides to climb the bank, but whatever left the prints needed only two steps. At one point, the animal had stepped over a fallen branch approximately three feet off the ground without breaking stride. I know sometimes big cats can leave footprints that appear to be two-legged, and there are still some panthers (mountain lions) left in the mountains of North Carolina, but if a cat made these marks it would have to have been the biggest panther in the world. They were about 14 inches long and seven inches wide. We thought perhaps the marks could have been made by clumps of snow falling from trees, but there were marks where there were no overhanging branches. We split up that day and two different groups walked along the road about a mile in each direction from the prints, but we never found where the animal had crossed the road, which means it was obviously using the road for traveling instead of trudging through the deep snow.","classification":"Class B","county":"Yancey","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.74875,"longitude":-82.26195,"latlng":"-82.26195,35.74875","locationDetails":"Yancey County, North Carolina, near the summit of Mt.

The day before these tracks appeared my daughter-in-law and I had hiked about a mile up the gulch looking for deer tracks. In backtracking the tracks of the two creatures we found that they had come upon our tracks at the head of the gulch and had followed them back to the  house and that the larger of the two had gone all around the house, barn and fields below the house. The smaller one stayed out by the rabbit hutches and had curiously curled feet.  The larger creatures prints measured 17 inches and the smaller one's prints measured 14 1/2 inches around the curved foot. We took pictures of the prints and the thing that struck us most about prints was that the creatures had to have been massive as it was very cold and the snow and ice on the ground was frozen so hard that we could jump up and down without breaking through to the ground, but every print of both creatures went completely through the ice.  We did not see the creatures them selves, only their prints.","classification":"Class B","county":"Silver Bow","state":"Montana","latitude":46.05292,"longitude":-112.571,"latlng":"-112.571,46.05292","locationDetails":"At Bull Run Gulch just northwest of Walkerville, Montana, a suburb of Butte, Montana.","dewPoint":3.96,"humidity":0.73,"cloudCover":0.22,"moonPhase":0.23,"pressure":1041.91,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.","uvIndex":1,"visibility":9.99,"highTemp":19.43,"midTemp":11.16,"lowTemp":2.89,"windBearing":216,"windSpeed":3.29}

It was solid black and looked to be between 4 1/2 feet tall and 5 feet tall and was running on 2 legs. I could not clearly make out any features in part because it was near sunset and in part because of the speed at which it ran. It appeared to running alongside the road heading down the southbound lane and very quickly turned and crossed the road. It stumbled slightly at the edge of the road and swung its arms to regain balance then continued across the road and into the tree line. I don't care to speculate how fast it was moving but I'm sure it was faster than a human, maybe about as fast as a deer can run.

Me, my sister and her friend found the keys to my brothers 4-wheeler and decided to sneak it out @ approx 10:30 pm on a snowy winter night. Nobody knew we were going to do this, so there is no way anyone could have been waiting for us in a costume or anything.  Plus nobody knew I even knew how to operate a 4 wheeler (including myself).   We headed out to the woods behind our parents house and half way down a steep hill the 4 wheeler took off flying and when I figured out what gear to put it in the 4 wheeler stopped and my sister and her friend jumped off.  I recall smelling something \"dead\" then I heard something that sounded like Monkeys (yes multiple) fighting.  When I looked towards the trees I see this huge monster walking out.  This thing was at least 7.5 or 8 ft tall and standing straight up with huge long arms and legs. As it was walking towards us it made a deep growling angry noise.  I took off on the 4- wheeler and my sister and her friend were running as fast as they could to catch up.  I looked back a few times and recall thinking- this thing is walking but one of it's steps was equal to 20 of mine.  We were in a panic we were all screaming and the louder our screams the deeper it's growl got. By the time my sisters friend had grabbed her arm and yanked her onto the 4 wheeler, it was within it's arms reach of us but never tried reaching out to hurt us. It was obvious he or she wanted us out of there.  I was only about 13 at the time so I wasn't wise enough to call someone to come research it.  I believe our parents just thought we were making it up.

This is a city mostly on a hill, but stretches down into a valley. On the east side, there is a great stretch of mountains known as the east ridge. This is where I was when I saw a sasquatch. In the middle of the hill, south of the Lady of the Rockies, there are two smaller hills jutting out of the middle of the hill. I was on the northern side of the southernmost small peak, heading down to go back to my vehicle. I was heading through some trees when I looked to the north at the other hill. This hill comes up further out from the main mountain than the hill that I was on. The peak is therefore more west, and then heading east it slopes down, flattens out, then heads back up the main mountain. I was looking through these trees I was heading through up at the flattened part of that hill. I was looking right at this tree. I'd say it was a good ten feet tall. I'd say I was about 200-300 yards away from this tree. He must have seen me, because when he walked out from behind that tree, I could tell he was looking right at me. And something about the way he timed it tells me he wanted to scare me. I'd say he was about 8 feet tall, judging from the distance, and he walked just like the saquatch in the old video of him walking through that small clearing in the forest. You all know the one. Probably the most popular one out there. His arms swayed back and forth, hanging limply from his shoulders. He walked about 15 feet then disappeared behind another tree.

We were northeest of Asheville, near the Blue Ridge Parkway.    (Busick is so small that google earth does not have a marker for it.)   On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark.   Later, while we were sitting near the campfire playing dominos, we heard the same yell and heard rustling in the woods nearby.   We couldn't distinguish what it was because there were some people singing christian hymns at a small theatre nearby.   Later that night, when I was asleep, my friends(they were brothers) were talking about the upcoming wedding of one of them this coming spring and the younger brother says that he saw it move through the woods very close to our camp.   He told me about it the next day and I got kind of scared, since I may have seen a bigfoot in New Mexico back in 1994 while in the boy scouts.   The next day the two brothers went on a long hike and I stayed in camp since I was experiencing foot problems and had no hiking boots.    I got really bored so I decided to walk down what seemed to be a game trail into the woods for a few hundred yards.   I noticed that there were a lot of trees that were broken, like something had bended them.   None of these trees were very thick, but there were a few that I knew I could not snap.   I started to get a little scared, like something wasn't right.   I was only about a 1/4 mile from the campground, and I saw it.   It scared the s**t out of me.   I only saw it for about 10-15 seconds(maybe, I was so scared it could've been 5 seconds or it could have been a minute), and the best way to describe it would be that it looked like the bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons only it was heavier and a little bit darker.   I was probably about 15-30 feet from it when I saw it.   We stared at each other for the duration of my sighting, and then it walked away as if I wasn't anything to worry about.    I stood in that spot for a little while and then walked back to the campsite, stopping every now and then to look around for the thing.

As with most classes, some students walked faster than others. I was with the stragglers, a few of whom were suffering from the cold and thin air. The trail had only been opened, as I recall, the previous day, and ours was the first group of the season to make the ascent. Lots of snow remained in shaded areas and in many places on the trail, and it was obvious no one had walked ahead of us, although a couple of older men on four wheelers passed us at one point. We were getting fairly close, within a half mile or so, to the lake; the slope was very steep. I remember our little group went past a switchback and we were uphill from a stream. Somewhere in this stretch, crossing the trail at a right angle, was a series of very large, apparently bipedal, tracks. In shape and contour, the tracks appeared human. No details, such as toe impressions, remained or could be readily detected, but every indication was that the tracks had been made by bare feet, not boots. The students immediately starting exclaiming, “Bigfoot, bigfoot!” Doing my best to downplay the tracks, I told the students that they were probably those of a hiker and that they had become enlarged as a result of melting and refreezing. Privately, I didn’t believe that story for a second. As far as I was concerned, the impressions were the record of something extremely unusual. The tracks were huge, at least sixteen inches or more in length and quite wide. The depth of the tracks in the snow and soil was far beyond what I could duplicate; it was obvious, even to the students, that whatever or whoever made the tracks had immense weight (I told them the “hiker” was probably carrying a very heavy pack). The distance between the tracks was on the order of four feet or more, an interval that was all the more impressive considering the extreme steepness of the mountain in that area. It did not seem possible to me for any human to duplicate such a feat (so to speak) as was performed by the mysterious maker of those tracks, especially considering the conditions of snow and slope. In addition, the tracks were not headed to Middle Fork Lake. Of course, that doesn’t prove anything, but I found it strange that anyone would hike up the mountain, avoiding the trail, and heading to something besides the lake. As best as I could determine, the tracks appeared to be going in the direction of Bull-of-the-Woods Mountain.","classification":"Class B","county":"Taos","state":"New Mexico","latitude":36.599,"longitude":-105.4113,"latlng":"-105.4113,36.599","locationDetails":"We were on the trail to Middle Fork Lake.

My wife opened the door and said that someone was standing outside the entry door to the bedroom of the trailer.  I went back to the room and saw a large shadow in the window.  The window is privacy glass so they couldn't see inside.  I could see a chest, a head and about half of the arm.   I reached into the night stand a took out my pistol thinking that it was someone.  I then started toward the back of the trailer to the main entry door.  While I was doing this my wife thought to take photos.  She took 3 photos which does show the shadow of whatever it was very well.  When I was at the other end of the trailer I opened the door and turned on the outside light at the same time.  There was nothing there, I did hear what sounded like someone walking very quickly in the distance.  I went around the trailer but couldn't see anyone.  It was at this time that I realized that the window on the door is too high for someone to have been standing there.  I took pictures to show how high it is.  We waited until daylight to go back outside, I looked around the front and side of the trailer and noticed what appeared to be large tracks in the gravel.  I took pictures of these.  My friend who is a photographer took a copy of the pictures showing the shadow in the window and enlarged them while trying to keep the clarity and it is possible to make out some of the features.  His exact words are \" it kind of looks like Harry from Harry and the Hendersons\".

{"id":"5697","timestamp":82684800,"title":"Three boys encounter sasquatch in eroded terrain","observed":"This is the second in a set of chronological reports that I am submitting regarding a series of encounters I had between 1970 and 1983 in Nevada, California, and Washington States. I grew up several miles Northwest of Reno, Nevada in the foothills of the Sierra's.  My father was a geologist who preferred sparsely populated areas, so we lived, camped, fished, gold panned, rockhounded, and hunted Indian and goldrush artifacts in some relatively remote places. This second encounter occured in August of 1972 in Lemmon Valley, Nevada.  Lemmon Valley is Northwest of Reno on US 395.  Though the area I am about to describe is now covered with housing developments, in 1972 there were only two developed areas in the valley.  Stead Air Force Base (deactivated in 1959)[N.B. below] was on the West side of the valley and the community of Lemmon Valley was on the East side.  The community of Lemmon Valley was, in reality, simply a strip of built up properties along Lemmon Valley road - just housing and few small businesses extending for about five miles toward the back of the valley and for a couple of hundred yards at most to either side of the road.  US 395 cut across the South and higher end of the valley at the base of Peavine Mountain's North slope.  Toward the back of the valley, the North or lower end, were a few small ranches.  Only a couple of improved dirt roads cut across the center of the valley connecting the community of Lemmon Valley to Stead. The climate was high desert.  Roughly 5000 feet in elevation with negligible year-round rainfall, but sometimes several feet of snow in the winter.  The humidity was generally less than ten percent and often as low as five.  Other than those planted near developed properties, there were no trees in the floor of the valley.  Scrub pine begins on the higher ridges about five miles West of the valley and thickens to fully developed arid pine forest as the elevation increases.  The dominant vegetation is sagebrush, mixed with a wide variety of large weeds and coarse grasses.  Jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and smaller rodents were very common, as were a wide variety of lizards and snakes.  Coyotes are common, but rarely seen.  Cougar and black bear are rare, but sometimes sighted in the area.  Deer stick to the surrounding higher elevations with more trees.  Other indigenous animals include hawks, falcons, and few burrowing owls.  Quail, and other ground nesting birds are also plentiful.  There is also a variety of large insect species (cicada, locusts, etc..) to round out the ecosystem.  At first glance, the area may not look like it supports much in the way of life, but it actually does.  Snow melt is the primary source of open water in the late spring and early summer and a small lake forms toward the back of the valley.  By late August this has usually dried up and the only sources of water are near human habitation. As I mentioned in my first report, the North face of Peavine Mountain was deforested in the late 1800's.  It has also eroded significantly over the last century as a natural result of the vegetation loss and due to hydraulic mining.  The runoff from the mountain was clearly heavy at some time in the past, because two deep washes cut through half the length of the valley flowing North from Peavine Mountain. These washes were eight to ten feet deep in places with vertical walls and averaged five to eight feet in width.  Walking down one was much like walking through a school hallway with slight curves.  Their depth would increase and decrease as they intersected the natural fingers and draws running down from the ridges that bounded the valley.  They were difficult to climb in and out of except at a few places where they shallowed out to a couple of feet as they intersected a draw.  Because they were shaded and contained a little more moisture than the surrounding terrain, they formed a small microclimate where certain species of lizard and an occassional scorpion could be found.  The sagebrush also grew a little taller (about three feet) along their edges.  Below, the floors of the washes were almost perfectly level, shaded, and protected from the wind.  Very little vegetation grew in the floors of the washes and was usually limited to tumbleweeds and some patches of coarse grass.  From the floor of the valley these washes were virtually invisible.  You could only tell where they were from a stripe of sagebrush running along their edges that was a little greener, thicker, and taller than the rest of the sagebrush in the valley.  You couldn't see them or see down into them until you were right on top of them. This encounter took place in the early afternoon in mid-August of 1972.  It was bright, sunny, and hot, about 85 degrees Fahrenheit, at the time.  The wind was less than five miles per hour.  I was twelve.  I was with my brother, who was ten, and a friend, David, who was also twelve.  For years, my brother and I had spent the summers exploring the surrounding hills and valley.  We knew all the best places to catch each type of lizard, the best places to look for arrowheads, where the trash dumps from the 1800's were (good for old bottles), and the best places to find old shell casings and such from when the airbase had been active.  We didn't often make it out as far as the dry washes, but when we did we made a point of exploring them because of the unique things like scorpions you could find in them.  We had just moved from Stead to the Lemmon Valley side of the valley and David, a new neighbor, was with us for the first and, as it turned out, only time. We had decided to go all the way out to the closest wash to show it to David, and were angling toward one of the shallow points where it would be easier to get into.  As we walked along we were searching the ground for horned toads, arrowheads, and anything else that might be interesting.  We were about twenty feet from the wash when we stumbled across an area with jasper and obsidian chips on the ground and started looking around in earnest for arrowheads and other stone tools.  My brother and I were seriously competitve when it came to hunting arrowheads. I was facing North, focusing on a piece of jasper I had just found, and had my back to my brother and David when I got a sudden feeling something was wrong.  I don't know whether I heard one of them gasp or just go abruptly quiet, but I knew there was a problem.  I had a sense of where my brother was a few feet behind me and turned to look at him.  As I turned clockwise from North to South I saw first David, about twenty-five feet away from me and a couple of feet from the rim of the wash, then what I perceived to be a giant black man about eight feet from David and about three feet away from the wash, and finally my brother, who was only about five feet behind me.  The giant black man was about thirty-five feet from me, standing still facing me with his arms at his sides looking directly at me (I guess he must have figured I was the lead male).  David was in shock, rooted to the ground, staring directly at him with his mouth wide open and his lower jaw level with his collarbones.  My brother was poised to run and looking from the \"man\", to me, and then to David in a panic.  As soon as I saw the man I took a step to run also, but realized David wasn't going anywhere and we'd need to help him if the \"man\" tried to do anything (we weren't that far from Reno and there are a lot of weird people who drift through that town - a man out of place in the desert is immediately considered dangerous).  I settled my weight and looked the \"man\" in the eye waiting for him to indicate his intentions. This all took about a second.  At this point my brother turned to me and screamed, \"That's not a man!  That's not a man!\"  Not breaking eye contact with the \"man\" I snapped back at him, \"Yes it is!\"  My brother immediately yelled \"No, it's not!\" and I snapped right back \"Then what is it?\"  which shut him up.  At that moment, in that situation, it was critically important to me that the \"man\" be nothing more than a man.  I also knew my brother and I could probably get away, but David was at risk and I intuitively sensed that it was important to control the fear, both by keeping the \"man\" just a man and by calming my brother. As I focused on the \"man\" I recognized that he was not overtly threatening but seemed stern and annoyed.  He didn't move a muscle and he didn't make a sound.  From his manner I gathered that he was not threatening us, but was determining if we were a threat to him - that we had disturbed him and he just wanted us to go away and leave him alone.  My brother and I would have been happy to oblige but David was still standing like a statue and we weren't leaving him behind so we all just stood there and stared at each other. I could see the \"man\" from the lower shins on up, and this is where it gets a little strange.  He was at least eight and a half feet tall, three and a half feet to four feet broad at the shoulder, and had a comparatively narrow waist.  His arms hung down to the top of his knees.  Not only was this \"man\" huge and slightly disproportionate, but in the middle of the afternoon, in the middle of August, to my perception, he was wearing a black down ski parka with the peaked hood up, matching black down ski pants, and black gloves.  Down ski-wear was a brand new fad with the skiers that came through Reno back then.  I thought to myself that it was strange that he had this brand new ski outfit, let alone one that fit his frame.  I thought he must have stolen it (I had already subconsciously assumed this guy was a hobo because we were at least a mile from the nearest road, there wasn't a vehicle in sight, and I couldn't think of a good reason for him to have apparently been hiding in the wash).  As I thought about it, the hobo assumption made sense.  The ski-suit was probably the only thing he had to wear and, at night, sleeping out in the open in the high desert it tended to get a little chilly, August or not.  There was even a little dirt on it in places, indicating he'd been lying on the ground in it. The \"man's\" bearing, though, didn't come across the way a homeless person's would.  He stood tall with his shoulders relaxed, but back.  His posture indicated a sense of self-worth that was almost regal and his gaze didn't flinch (as an afterthought, there was nothing about his eyes to give me the impression that he lacked human intelligence).  Even under the ski suit you could tell that he had a massively muscled upper body, and the ratio of shoulders to waist were those of a world-class athlete.  For a moment I considered that I was looking at fur-covered muscle and immediately killed the thought, then started to look a little closer anyway.  This was when he simply broke eye contact, turned, stepped down into the wash at the shallow point where he was standing and walked away down the wash without looking back (this was a little strange in retrospect because there was absolutely no indication in body language or eye movement to telegraph that he had decided our encounter was over - he simply turned and left without acknowledgement).  Within a couple of steps he disappeared around a slight curve in the wall of the wash as it cut through the next finger off of the ridge.  We had stood looking at each other for maybe forty-five seconds. I didn't move for a couple of seconds after he disappeared, waiting to give him time to go before moving to check on David.  I'd never seen anybody so afraid that they were frozen on the spot before and I was concerned about him.  As I walked up to David, looking cautiously down the wash as I got a better angle on it, my brother followed me and said in a voice that seemed to beg me to believe him, \"That wasn't a man.\"  Standing in front of David, I looked him in the eye and said, \"Yes it was.  It was just a big, black hobo.\"  That ended the discussion.  I asked David if he was ok.  He just shook his head yes and didn't say anything.  My brother moved up to the edge of the wash to see as far down it as he could and I asked if he could see the guy.  He couldn't and we started to leave when curiosity got the better of us and my brother asked, \"What do you think he was doing down there?\"  I thought about it for a second and decided I wanted to know, too, so we walked along the edge of the wash for a hundred yards or so to make sure he wasn't hiding close enough to threaten us (the guy wasn't carrying anything and I was worried that we would find his camp about the time he came back to it to get his belongings).  We walked back down to the shallow spot in the wash and jumped down into it.  I briefly recognized that the \"man\" had simply stepped down the three feet I had just jumped, but didn't say anything. We walked both up and down the wash a hundred feet or so looking for a campsite.  We didn't find one.  No firepit, no food wrappers, no trash, no drug paraphenalia, no signs that a human had been camping there.  The floor of the wash was granite sand so there really weren't any footprints that I could recognize to indicate where he may have been.  We did find a spot where someone had taken pieces of tumbleweed and sticker bush and embedded them in the wall of the wash.  Tumbleweed and pieces of bush were also arranged on the floor of the wash at the same spot.  Those embedded in the wall of the wash were arranged in a tall half-oval with the peak about four and a half feet high.  Those on the floor of the wash were also arranged in a half oval that joined the first.  It was about the right size for the guy to sit cross-legged in with his back against the wall of the wash. At that time I had never heard of Bigfoot, so it wasn't even an option for me to consider within the framework of the encounter.  Even though several things about the encounter were strange I convinced myself that we had been confronted by a man.  What else could it have been?  About ten days later, though, something happened that forced me to admit that there was something in the valley that was manlike but wasn't a man.  I'll submit that as my third report soon.","classification":"Class A","county":"Washoe","state":"Nevada","latitude":39.679,"longitude":-119.6665,"latlng":"-119.6665,39.679","locationDetails":"Described in context above.","dewPoint":26.36,"humidity":0.29,"cloudCover":0.41,"moonPhase":0.21,"pressure":1014.1,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":9.68,"highTemp":74.49,"midTemp":58.43,"lowTemp":42.37,"windBearing":248,"windSpeed":3.23}
{"id":"5770","timestamp":83548800,"title":"Four feral dogs chase sasquatch","observed":"This is the third in a set of chronological reports that I am submitting regarding a series of encounters I had between 1970 and 1983 in Nevada, California, and Washington States. This third encounter occurred in August 1972, when I was 12, at my home, roughly ten days after our encounter at the dry wash. I have previously described nearby Peavine Mountain and Lemmon Valley.  Our house was located on the East side of the valley.  It was in a new development at the time, tucked back in a draw among several steep hills.  The surrounding hills rose from 50 to 250 feet above our neighborhood and were primarily granite outcroppings.  The soil was coarse granite sand interspersed with boulders of various sizes.  Where there was vegetation on the hills, it was predominantly sagebrush.  In the draws, the sand was less coarse and there were a variety of grasses and other weeds. We had just moved into the newly completed house a few weeks earlier and were getting to know our neighbors, all of whom had just moved into their new homes as well.  Like many of our neighbors, we were building a fence and otherwise improving our property.  At the time, there was only one thing to detract from the new neighborhood -- the presence of a pack of feral dogs. The pack was composed of four large dogs -- two Dobermans and a couple of mixed breeds.  They were a matter of some concern because many of the new residents had small children and the pack displayed absolutely no trace of fear of people.  They would generally appear around dusk, when it began to cool, and boldly range through the neighborhood.  At night you could often hear them in the surrounding hills, barking and baying occasionally.  It didn't take long to determine that they had no owner and one of our neighbors, an animal control officer for the city of Reno, told us that he had arranged for the county to do something about them. Our home was an \"L\" shaped ranch, with two of four bedrooms in the back, at the top of the \"L\", and a garage in front, at the bottom right of the \"L\", facing the street.  We had partially constructed a cedar plank fence around the property, starting in back and working our way around the property clockwise.  We had completed the fence on the side of the property at the top of the \"L\", and had built a small section of fence connecting the back left corner of the \"L\" to the fence on that side.  This created a small cul-de-sac behind the house.  Along the side of the property to the right of the \"L\", we had set the posts and rails.  Along the front, where we intended to connect it to the garage, at the lower right corner of the \"L\", we had set the posts, but hadn't yet put in the rails.  You could, essentially, walk right into our back yard from the street side of the house, but could not leave the yard on the back side without climbing over the fence. On the night of the encounter, I had picked up all of the two-by-fours we hadn't used as rails yet and I had stacked them horizontally along the base of the fence back in the cul-de-sac.  This was a precaution since they were pilferable and we weren't the only ones building a new fence. My bedroom was at the top, right corner of the \"L\".  The ground outside my window was about a foot and a half below the floor of my room.  My mother had already planted a small flowerbed of marigolds there.  To protect it, she had me put in one of those small, white-painted, wire trellises that reminds you of a bunch of coat-hangers welded together.  To put it in I had to heavily wet down the ground, then force it in.  Once the ground dried, the powdered granite and sand set like concrete.  It was about a foot high. The incident occurred between midnight and 12:30 am.  It was late summer and I was awake late reading.  I had my window open, but the drapes were closed.  That night, the pack of feral dogs had been more noisy than usual.  Every so often, their barking would become particularly strident, drawing my attention away from my book.  I remember thinking to myself, over the course of fifteen minutes or so, that they were chasing another jackrabbit, then deciding that it must be a coyote, since they'd been going at it for longer than usual, then wondering if they might have a cougar at bay, since they were still barking and baying loudly, but seemed stationary. I was just turning back to my book, when I realized that they had started moving again, and were coming down the street in the direction of the house.  I started to sit up, intending to go to the living room window to see what they were chasing, but realized that they would be well past the house before I could get to the living room in front.  As I listened, though, the noise of the pursuit didn't decrease the way I expected it to do as they chased their quarry past the opposite side of the house.  Instead it grew louder, and I realized that, whatever they were chasing, they were chasing it into our back yard.  I also realized that they might corner it behind the house in the cul-de-sac.  Excited, I started to get up to look out the window. Before I could get up, though, their quarry rounded the back right corner of the garage heading in the direction of my bedroom at the back right corner of the house.  For just a second, I could clearly hear it running, as the sound of the dogs was still partially masked around the corner of the garage.  As it covered the twenty feet between the two corners, I heard three distinct, heavy footfalls -- one just as it rounded the garage, one midway between the garage and the corner of the house, and the third just under my window, where the wire trellis was set firmly into the ground.  This was followed by an incredible impact into the corner of the house.  The force was so great that I could hear the four-by-four upright in the wall crack and the whole room shook.  The impact and cracking sound came from a point about five and a half feet above the level of the ground outside.  Simultaneously, there was a secondary impact about seven feet above ground level across the top right corner of my window as viewed from outside.  The window rattled violently in the frame and I was sure it was cracked.  Immediately following the two simultaneous impacts, there was a forced grunt as if the wind had been knocked out of whatever it was and I could hear its body fall heavily to the ground. My first thought was, \"Oh my God!  They're chasing a man!\"  The footfalls were clearly bipedal, the height of the impacts was too high for it to be anything four-legged, and the sound of it having its wind knocked out was manlike, if somewhat heavy.  Also from the sound of its fall, it went from an erect to a prone position.  At the same time I recognized that something was strange.  The \"man\" hadn't called for help, hadn't made any vocal noises at all, in fact.  He had covered twenty feet in what was essentially two strides, and had hit the house at a point too high for all but the largest of men.  The secondary impact across the outside corner of the window was also too high for most people to reach, and the force of the impact, strong enough to make the four-by-four in the house's frame crack, indicated much more mass than any normal person would have. I didn't spend any time really thinking about this, though.  Even though I had an underlying uneasiness because the sounds indicated that the guy was huge, I was sure the dogs were chasing a man.  The dogs closed on the man, snarling and barking.  I was afraid he was lying on the ground, injured or unconscious, and I realized that I had to do something.  I immediately threw my sheet off, jumped out of bed, and reached for the drapes, intending to throw them open and yell at the dogs -- about all I could do in the situation.  In the two or three seconds it took to do this, though, it didn't sound like the dogs were mauling the man.  They were about three feet from the house, stationary, barking and growling.  It sounded as if there were only three of them, two very aggressive and ready to attack, and one that was barking the way a dog would if it were afraid of you, but ready to attack if provoked. Just as my fingertips touched the drapes, the scariest thing I have ever experienced in my life happened (believe me, this is saying a lot for someone who has spent nineteen years in the military and lived through a parachute malfunction).  Somehow the man had recovered from hitting the house, having the wind knocked out of him, and falling.  He had somehow managed to stand up and get his breath back and just as I touched the drapes, from a point immediately outside my window, level with and about two feet from my head, He Growled Back at the dogs. The growl wasn't loud.  It was only about two and a half seconds long.  But it was the meanest, deepest, and most menacing growl I have ever heard in my life (to include those of trapped brown bears at Yellowstone).  It was almost as if he was keenly aware that there were people around, that he knew precisely how long he had to growl to get his point across, and that he didn't want to make any more noise than he absolutely had to. For the next several seconds there was absolute silence.  He didn't make any more noise.  The dogs didn't even make any sounds of movement.  And I was frozen in fear and shock, praying that he wouldn't notice I was there, and afraid he would hear me if I moved at all. It was like that for several long seconds, then, all but silently, I heard him step and brush around the corner of the house. A second later the dogs were after him, but the head start was all he needed.  I heard the stack of two-by-fours tumble down and the sound of him hitting the six foot cedar fence as he went over it, followed by the dogs hitting the fence and then scratching at it and barking.  After a few moments the dogs stopped trying to get over the fence and raced back around the house clockwise. As I heard the dogs racing down the street, I relaxed slightly and gulped for breath.  I hadn't even realized I'd been holding it.  I immediately choked.  The \"Thing\" had left an incredible stench.  It was overpowering.  It smelled like a combination of wet dog, stale urine, and rancid sweat.  There was also an acrid component a little like burnt rubber.  It was so bad that I staggered away from the window. I stood there for a few moments trying to decide what to do.  The thing was gone, the dogs were gone, and all I would accomplish by waking my parents would be to anger my father.  I decided it wasn't worth it.  I thought about going outside but really didn't want to poke around out there in the dark.  I was struggling with what I had just experienced.  Whatever had been outside my window was manlike, but clearly was not a man.  I had no frame of reference to place it in.  I didn't relate the experience to my encounter at the dry wash because I had so thoroughly convinced myself that that had been a man.  I closed my window (which to my amazement was not broken), got back in bed, and tried to read to get my mind off of the incident.  Eventually I fell asleep. The next morning I woke after my father had left for work.  I looked out my window and could see that the flowerbed -- trellis and all -- had been flattened.  I got dressed and went outside.  The ground was scuffed but there were no distinctive footprints.  I choked down my apprehension and walked back into the fenced cul-de-sac behind the house.  The stack of two-by-fours was lying there toppled.  I looked at the cedar fence.  The scratch marks from the dogs' nails were clear.  Caught on the top of one of the planks was a tuft of coarse hair.  I stepped up on the lower rail of the fence and looked at it closely in the bright morning sunlight.  It was dark black with hints of brownish red highlights and about three inches long.  It had enough oil on it make it shine if you looked at it closely.  I struggled with whether it had come from the \"thing\" or one of the dogs.  After several moments of consideration I decided it was possible one of the Dobermans could have had some three inch strands of hair, that the colors were within the appropriate range, and that one of the dogs might actually have managed to make it over the fence to leave it there.  I left it where it was. I went back to the window and examined it and the siding on corner of the house closely.  I didn't see any damage from the impacts.  I decided that the thing had been running, hadn't seen the trellis, and had tried to cut around the corner of the house too closely.  The trellis, strongly embedded in the cement-like soil, tripped it and it fell, throwing its left arm(?) up in an attempt to maintain balance (or maybe grab the roof to catch itself).  The primary impact would have been from its body.  The secondary impact could have been from the left arm slapping the side of the house across the corner of the window. I went in and told my mother about the incident.  I was still very troubled and wanted to know what I had heard.  I discussed it at length with my father when he got home.  He was uncharacteristically patient and explained that it had either been a bear or a cougar.  I couldn't accept either of these explanations.  It wasn't until about a year later that I ran across a tourist pamphlet in Oregon that was about Bigfoot.  I can't express how relieved I was at the time to learn that there was a potential explanation for what I had experienced. We never saw or heard the dogs again after that night.","classification":"Class B","county":"Washoe","state":"Nevada","latitude":39.679,"longitude":-119.6665,"latlng":"-119.6665,39.679","locationDetails":"Described in context above.","dewPoint":31.92,"humidity":0.31,"moonPhase":0.53,"pressure":1012.33,"weatherSummary":"Clear throughout the day.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":10,"highTemp":85.33,"midTemp":66.81,"lowTemp":48.29,"windBearing":43,"windSpeed":1.54}

But anyway, we were playing in the yard it was close to getting dark but still daylight enough so that you could still see.  I don't quite remember if I heard a noise or what made me look across our road but when I looked, across the road on the edge of the woods I saw an image, similar to drawings I've seen of actual encounters.   It was walking at the edge of the woods kind of stooped over, using its hands to push the trees back out of its way.   All I could do was just stand there and look at it not really knowing what I was seeing.   I really don't know how long I stood there but I remember yelling at my sister who was then 7 years old, and telling her to run into the house.   She then looked and saw the same thing. As soon as I yelled at my sister it stopped dead in its tracks and just stood there and looked at us.   My sister and I still remember the feeling of not being able to move, and to this day we still get cold chills and our eyes water every time we talk about this. So anyway we eventually ran inside the house.  When we got in the house I remember my mom asking what was wrong because she said that both of us were as white as sheet.  We then went on to tell her what we had seen and were terrified to have her go outside  and check things out. Neither one of my parents ever saw anything but still to this day say they believe we did see something, whether it was someone playing a joke or possibly a bear but I still think to this day that it was Bigfoot or something similar.","classification":"Class A","county":"Washington","state":"Ohio","latitude":39.40877,"longitude":-81.73172,"latlng":"-81.73172,39.40877","dewPoint":61.85,"humidity":0.82,"cloudCover":0.99,"moonPhase":0.97,"pressure":1014.71,"weatherSummary":"Overcast throughout the day.","uvIndex":6,"visibility":4.09,"highTemp":71.53,"midTemp":66.82,"lowTemp":62.11,"precipitationIntensity":0.0003,"precipitationProbability":0.31,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":357,"windSpeed":5.36}

We watched the fireworks, then I offered to drive her home. I don't know the township road, but it is off state Route 676. We parked for a while then drove on to where she was staying. On the way to the house she had fallen asleep with her head in my lap, so she didn't see a thing. As I drove about 15 mph along these backroads, I rounded a slight turn where the banks on either side rose about six feet. On both sides of the road were fence and cornfields. Then, on the left side of the road behind the fence was a large hair covered, gray or white colored figure standing by the fence line. I was stunned and didn't say a word and just kept driving along slowly looking at this thing. As I went by it just looked at me. I didn't have a clue what to do, so I kept going. When I looked in the rear view mirror I saw it turn and go back into the cornfield. I didn't tell anyone for a while, but eventually told a couple friends who just smiled.","classification":"Class A","county":"Washington","state":"Ohio","latitude":39.46019,"longitude":-81.54855,"latlng":"-81.54855,39.46019","locationDetails":"A few miles off State Route 676 on a township road.","dewPoint":63.92,"humidity":0.75,"cloudCover":0.88,"moonPhase":0.2,"pressure":1012.61,"weatherSummary":"Rain starting in the evening.","uvIndex":6,"visibility":4.92,"highTemp":76.01,"midTemp":72.325,"lowTemp":68.64,"precipitationIntensity":0.0096,"precipitationProbability":0.63,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":198,"windSpeed":7.61}

We ranged from the ages of  8 to 14 me being the oldest. We divided up in teams of two, my brothers were on a team and were going to go hide to which me and my cousin would try and find them after giving them some time to hide. We heard them scream and we stood up and were kinda worried because we were on the opposite side of the house than them. So we got up to make sure they were all right, but they came around the house before we could get to far. They went on to tell us that they heard something really big running in the thick patch of woods. My brother was going into the thicket to hide. When he started in that's when he heard something take off running. The sun was about to disappear as night grew nearer and he was still spooked from the noise he heard and refused to go hide anymore. I just thought that it was probably a deer since our area is very populated with them. So we got off the porch and was walking around the corner of the house when I looked up towards the road. Now to give you a brief description of the terrain. From where the thicket ends there is about 20 yards of short mowed grass which meets up with State Route 550 then on the other side of the road it slopes down fairly sharp and then into a cornfield. As it was striding across the road is where I saw it. It's arms were swaying back and forth and I remember the hair hanging from its arms. The body was very thick, thicker than any human body I've ever seen. The head looked like it ended in a point rather than a rounded head like a humans. It seemed to run in slow motion as I stood there in amazement. It went over the bank when it got to the other side of the road. We jumped up onto the porch and went inside to tell my dad. He just laughed at us and so have most people that I have told this to since then.

We lived in a trailer park away from town, but I can't remember what road it was on. One evening I was home alone. My mother had gone to pick up my stepfather. It was around 8-9 pm. I was sitting in the living room watching TV when my dog starting acting strange. He stood up with his hackles raised and started to growl, staring at the back door of the trailer. The back door of the trailer was in the hallway just off the living room. We had an outside light on the telephone pole in the backyard which was shining into the privacy window of the back door. His behavior caught my attention because he was a gentle natured dog who loved people. This was the first and only time I ever heard him growl like that. As I looked up to see what was bothering him, I noticed a shadow filling the entire window of the back door. My dog lifted his nose to sniff in the direction of the door, and suddenly his posture changed in an instant. He started cowering, tucked his tail between his legs, and quickly came over to hide by me. I had never seen him act this way before. Then the shadow went by the living room window, and it nearly filled the entire window. The shadow stayed in place for a few seconds, then moved away from the trailer. I could smell a faint skunk-like odor as well. I didn't have the courage to open the door and look outside for the source of the shadow. I wasn't even about to walk down the hall to my bedroom until my mother got home. (My dog didn't want to walk down the hall either.) We were both petrified! We stayed on the couch until my mother and stepfather came home about 30-45 minutes later. I'm sure they were puzzled as to why I was huddled on the couch with my dog, instead of in bed. I was afraid to tell them about the incident. Now I wish I would have at least told my mother. I've always wondered what could have been large enough to fill the whole window like that.","classification":"Class B","county":"Texas","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.5656,"longitude":-92.1426,"latlng":"-92.1426,37.5656","locationDetails":"I don't remember how to get there.","dewPoint":42.48,"humidity":0.59,"cloudCover":0.27,"moonPhase":0.87,"pressure":1013.72,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy until evening.","uvIndex":4,"visibility":7.97,"highTemp":65.51,"midTemp":50.245,"lowTemp":34.98,"windBearing":288,"windSpeed":6.87}

But though I have forgotten many things from my 20's the pictures in my mind .. even the sounds of breaking twigs .. everything from that night is still crystal clear. I have not questioned what we saw ever and still hold true to the fact that what we saw was nothing other than what is called \" big foot \". It was August I believe 1994, Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area outside of Branson Mo. 1:00 A.M. A friend of mine and I had just got off work and pulled over at what was then the scenic overlook. A trail at that time wound back and forth in appropriately 60 foot lengths as it progressed up the hill to an old fire tower. If i was there I could show you exactly where we were and where \" it \" was but i will do my best to describe. We had gone up the path two turns when we heard a loud snapping sound in the quiet night. we both instantly froze and looked up. Between the 3rd and fourth path turn we could see it. a huge large slightly slumped big foot. Long arms ... sillouetted almost by the city lights and open area behind it .. we just stood there. Shocked... the friend I was with after what seemed like 5 minutes of frozen still .. yelled HEY .. and then one foot from it ... a second slightly shorter one stood up and turned to look right at us then they both ran off. The running was so significant because they ran on back legs but hunched over with long arms and it was loud. Snapping twigs and pushing their bodies right through small trees in the way. We waited a moment and then walked the trail to where they had been standing. Using a close by tree to estimate the height of the tallest. it had to be at least 7.5 feet tall if it wasn't slumped. We heard another snap in the woods and ran full sprint to the fire tower at the top of the hill and stayed there the entire night. We didn't talk much about it ... still in shock I think ..

We were just trying to get back to the car, which was parked, on a dirt road about a mile up a ridge that was directly in front of us. The brush we were walking through was thick, really difficult to get through. We were walking single file and I was behind my friend with my head down concentrating on just trying to get through the brush with out tripping. Suddenly I heard an incredibly loud disturbance to my left and at the same time my friend had froze in his tracks. As I looked to my left, this animal, there is no doubt a Bigfoot, came tearing down the ridge right in front of us. It could not have been 10-15 feet from us. It was so close, it must have been sleeping and we woke it, because something that big would have made a lot of noise crashing through the brush on approach, and I heard nothing until it was right on us. We both watched it run past us to our right, on down this ridge and disappear into the forest. It was huge, covered with black fur and long, long arms. As it went by us it turned its face toward us and its face was flat and hairless, but almost black, like its face had been caked with mud all its life. It was bent forward slightly, running and it was still 7-8 feet tall. I was shocked at the speed. This encounter took no longer than 10 seconds. We both stood there scared to death, really scared. We both were familiar with the concept of Bigfoot, and had heard the stories of \"monsters in the woods\". After we both got under control, I said, \"what was that\" and my friend said \"I don’t know but I'm getting out of here\". We both started to run as best we could for the fence line and the road about a mile in front of us. When we reached the road, we were climbing a fence that lined the road, as were crossing this fence we heard the most bone chilling scream I have ever heard in my life.

{"id":"4421","timestamp":390268800,"title":"Soldier in basic training has daylight sighting at Fort Leonard Wood.","observed":"I was going through Army basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.  Our platoon was on the last leg of our training and one of our final training events was guard duty at different locations throughout the post.  We were paired up and given our assignments, issued our weapons and three live rounds (Barney Fife-esque), and proceeded to load up on a deuce and a half (army 2.5 ton truck).  As we loaded up into the truck, I was the last one on since my last name starts with \"Y\", and we always did things alphabetically (significance to come later). It was mid to late afternoon and the trainee I was paired with and I were assigned to guard a bridge crossing training site that army engineers use.  It was the furthest guard site from main post, so we were to be dropped off first to guard it overnight (didn't really need any guarding since it was unoccupied at night and weekends, plus it was in the middle of nowhere - we were doing this merely for the training benefit.)  I don't really have any idea where the site was and didn't really care, all that I knew is that we must've been traveling for about 20 - 30 minutes from main post when my sighting occurred.  It must've been about 1600 - 1700 hours and we were on dirt roads.  I was sitting on the bed of the truck looking out the back, while everyone else in the platoon were able to snag bench seats on either side of the vehicle facing one another.  Everyone else was sleeping or drowsing at the time, except for me in my uncomfortable seat on the bed of the truck.  We came to a \"T\" intersection and turned left. About 30-40 feet from the intersection the other direction, I observed a bigfoot.  What is amazing to me to this day is that I am the sort of person who really doesn't believe anything unless I observe it myself, but at that initial glance, I knew immediately that it was a bigfoot - not a bear, not a big person dressed up, just a bigfoot, no doubt.  A bigfoot was on the road, looked in the direction of the vehicle, and ambled across the road into the woods.  My second thought was to scream and yell to notify someone else in the platoon, but I immediately quashed this idea since by the time I would be able to rouse anyone, the bigfoot would probably be in the woods by then.  No need for me to be rambling on about a bigfoot without any other eyewitnesses in this type of environment.  So I alone observed it. My sighting was of short duration, about 10 seconds if that, and I don't have a lot of details, but I remember that it was tall, had to be at least 6.5 feet to 7.5 feet.  I don't remember any distinctive features, except for one.  Bigfoot had brown to light brown hair/fir coloration.  I though this was extrodinary since every previous thought that I had about bigfoot comprised of black fir.  That's about it, except that during this short sighting, my mind went through all the possible explanations of what this could be besides a bigfoot and dismissed all of them.  No doubt in my mind that I saw a bigfoot. After my sighting, we were dropped of about 10 minutes later and I spent an extremely nervous night in the wilderness at this river crossing sight.  Kind of glad I had my 3 Barney Fife rounds.  I was not really surprised that they called this \"Fort Lost-In-The-Woods\" as a nickname, because it is really isolated.  I have never really made a big deal of this sighting, or do I plan to.  All I know is that bigfoot exists, and I saw it.  I am probably one of the most credible witnesses that I can imagine.  I spent 15 years in the army, most of them as an army intelligence officer, before taking an early out and now I am a civilian working for the Coast Guard as an intelligence specialist in a District office of law enforcement.","classification":"Class A","county":"Pulaski","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.714,"longitude":-92.173,"latlng":"-92.173,37.714","locationDetails":"All I know is that it was about 5-10 minutes drive from a river crossing training site somewhere on Fort Leonard Wood.","dewPoint":56.16,"humidity":0.66,"cloudCover":0.38,"moonPhase":0.74,"pressure":1014.22,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy throughout the day.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":8.36,"highTemp":82.51,"midTemp":73.645,"lowTemp":64.78,"precipitationIntensity":0.0008,"precipitationProbability":0.49,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":192,"windSpeed":8.19}

{"id":"3667","timestamp":995587200,"title":"Eerie vocals in the forests of Karlin.","observed":"My girlfriend and I both live in a small area, filled and surrounded by hills and forests.  During the summer I would often stay at my her house until midnight before going home.  Often (once or twice a week) I would hear strange noises coming from the woods next to her house as I walked to my car.  It sounded like people laughing, only a little different... it's tough to explain.  It was like laughter, but there was something off about it.  It just didn't sound like human laughter.  The sound was terrifying.  It was almost like it was artificial, but I know that it couldn't have been someone trying to play a trick.  There are very few people nearby, and they're all older people and farmers.  Anyway, the \"laughing\" continued for two or three months.  Eventually, my girlfriend admitted that on her daily walk through the hills she had heard strange sounds as well, but the calls she heard were more like babies crying rather than people laughing.  She also found it to be eerie and inhuman.  she eventually heard the laughter too, as did her mother and one of her neighbors.  it disappeared for some time, but then came back about a few weeks later, just in time to keep her and her visiting sister from sleeping.  After that, whatever it was became more bold.  It started venturing into her yard at almost exactly 2:00 AM every morning.  We would both hear it walking around outside, going through her trash, and knocking things over.  Her dogs would usually get riled up and bark at it for about an hour every night (until it left, I suppose). One dog was apparently kicked or attacked by it, because I heard it being struck and a sharp yelp, then the following day it seemed to limp a bit and was afraid of us.  After that, I didn't really hear much from whatever it was again.  The phenomena went on for over half a year, but as soon as it started getting cold things suddenly stopped.  Maybe it migrated, I don't know.  I don't know what it looked like either, since I never actually saw it.  I tried to find it, but never came up with any physical evidence other than missing apples and overturned garbage cans.  I've figured it was probably a MoMo, or something of that sort.

My daughter was 1-2 years old, so it would have had to have been in 1988 or 1989. We were going from Crocker, MO. to Waynesville/St. Robert, MO. to Wal-Mart.  We crossed the Waynesville/Crocker bridge on Hwy. 17 (North of Waynesville, South of Crocker) and were almost out of the \"Waynesville Corners\" --this highway has several corners and curves after the bridge because it has a bluff on one side and the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River on the other.  When we were almost through the corners and coming up on the \"40 MPH Speed Limit Sign\" which means that we are getting close to entering the Waynesville,  MO. city limits.  It was a winter night, about 7:00 pm and had been dark for about 2 hours .  We rounded a corner and were meeting a car--both of us had our headlights on -- and there in the middle of the road--standing right on the yellow line which separates the two lanes--is this \"thing.\"  It was about 7-8 feet tall and covered with hair.  It was almost \"frozen,\" much like a deer is when the headlights of a car hit it.  My husband was driving and he slammed on the breaks, as did the car that we had met.  At this time, we were just passed the creature, as was the other car.  But, both of us had stopped--and there standing on the yellow line of Hwy.17, and being illuminated by the tail lights of both vehicles--still stood this creature.  It stood there for about 30 seconds and then it sort of leaped off the roadway and into the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River.  At this time, I was extremely scared and was pleading with my husband to just \"GO!\"--so we took back off, as did the other car.  We continued on toward Waynesville and the other car continued on toward Crocker.  We did not get out to  investigate, and as far as I know, the other car didn't either. We had no weapons with us (just in case we would need them) and it was dark--and suddenly very eerie.

We were taking a last minute look at my garden which is very close to the house.  We had only been out there a couple of minutes and then we heard the most unusual screaming sound.  My daughter asks if it was a coyote and I said NO and ushered her back to the house.  The call came less than 150 feet from the house.  It was loud and remarkable.  The dog that usually barks and runs after everything ran under the house. I did not say what I thought it was to her; instead we looked on the internet for sounds that might occur, like coyotes, panthers, fox, Barn owls, etc. After going through the whole directory.  She asks what the sound was.  We then listened to recorded sounds from Big Foot recordings.  Our stomachs turned. Yes, that is exactly what it sounded like.  I have lived in the country most of my life.  I grew up listening to coyotes and the occasional panther, bobcats, owls, Ferrell dogs and deer they all can make weird sounds.

Every morning we do physical exercises such as running.  That morning we did a 3.8 mile run on the \"Engineer Trail\".  The Engineer trail is a giant 3.8 mile track that has about 10 acres of land in the middle of the circle for land navigation exercises, and towards the back of the track opens up into a giant forest that feeds into Misty Mountain and the outer section of the post.  That land behind the track is 100+ acres I'd say.  On the morning of 1 October, 2014 around 0600- 0615, we (about 15 Soldiers) started our run individually, so we were spread out being some were faster than others.  About midway through the track, we came across a barrier.  A tree about 3-4 feet in diameter that looked to be healthy, not rotten, and relatively in good shape was laid across the track.  We haven't had any crazy wind storms that could've knocked it over, but at any rate myself and other soldiers didn't think anything of it.  As i continued on my run, I encountered another tree that was knocked over but it looked as if someone, maybe some soldiers, had drug it off the road.  Same diameter as the other one, but almost as if someone didn't want us on the track.  I continued on my run and about a mile and half I reached the the back side of the track where it meets the woods that go towards the eastern side of the border of post.  That's when I started hearing a yell that kind of sounded like \"whoops\".  It must've been around 200 feet away.  I immediately stopped running and started listening.  That's when I heard around 5 different \"whoops\".  I say around 5 because each time I heard it, I had to change the position of my head each time I heard one.  3 were from inside the circle of the track, and about 2-4 were on the border of track on the backside.  Being that I was out there alone, (I was in the lead of the pack of Soldiers) I didn't want to encounter what I was hearing I started running to get away from the back side of the track and back towards the civilization side with a quickness.  I know what I heard immediately being that I google, youtube, and watch a lot of documentaries on bigfoot.  The thing was when I got back to the start point, I didn't want to mention what I had heard in fear I might be made fun of or something.  So when the rest of the group caught up and finished.  They immediately started talking about the sounds.  A few of them even mentioned \"bigfoot calls\", with a seriousness.  Most people when they talk about bigfoot, you always get the guys who are sarcastic and snobby.  Well this group of Soldiers we all agreed, there was a family of them out there talking to each other out there on the track. On top of that, I have encountered this odor before when me and my wife will go ride trails on the 4 wheeler, a musky odor.  The entire run, all I could describe the odor as is like a musky/ sewage smell the entire route.  We have ran that route several times, and normally all you smell are the trees and weeds around.  This time it was completely odorless almost to a gagging kind of way.

In this instance, again I didn't so much see anything as hear it. The first incident took place in the middle of November of 2012.  It was in a rural area of Missouri outside the city of Rayville.  The area is a mix of farm and woodland.  It was approximately 9pm when I drove to a friend's house.  As I was walking from my car to his door I noticed what sounded like someone or something big walking about 30 or 40 yards away from me in the woods. It was just beyond the range of what I could see into the woods. When I stopped walking it stopped walking and when I started to walk it began again.  It was only about a 40 foot walk to the door and I walked slowly as I tried to figure this out.  About half way I stopped to think and it stopped once more.  From what I heard it was a sound of only 2 feet walking and was large.  It didn't sound at all like a 4 foot creature like a deer.  I went in to tell my friend but when we came out there was no sound.  About a week later I came out again and was walking to the door and jokingly called out \"are you there bigfoot?\" and laughed to myself. As I approached the door something flew out of the woods and hit my friends car.  Later in the evening when I left, in the distance I heard dogs going crazy and the sound of something large screaming.  It has been several weeks since I last heard anything but my friend says he too has heard the sound of something walking in the woods.  I have thought about if it was a person possibly playing a joke but no one knew I was going there.  Thought about it being another animal but it sounded too big to be a deer.  It has me extremely curious so I would love some feedback and your thoughts.  As I say I am not one quick to jump to conclusions and tend to be the first to look for other causes to things.","classification":"Class B","county":"Ray","state":"Missouri","latitude":39.20894,"longitude":-94.2908,"latlng":"-94.2908,39.20894","locationDetails":"This happened near Rayville, Mo.

{"id":"46826","observed":"Me, my uncle and son was bow hunting for deer and had set us a camp alongside of a food plot that the state park had planted for the wildlife. The day was October the 17, 2014 at approximately 10 pm. We were at camp sitting around the camp fire, when these woops and low growls started happening around us. My uncle went into the camper and got his mag flashlight which produces a very bright light, and started scanning the food plot. As he was scanning it, we saw this reflection which resembled a light shining off of a mirror. Now the reflection came from behind a tree top or brush pile, when we saw it the whole tree top began to shake and move around. Soon the tree top stopped moving and then we heard these footsteps moving through the woods behind the food plot. Well, fear soon set in and we all made our way to the camper went in and locked the door behind us. After an hour or so, I had to bleed my bladder like something fierce. However, after what I saw, I refused to go outside by myself. So with a little persuasion, my uncle and son decided to go out with me. Almost immediately, the woops, howls, and the low growls started up. My uncle just could not resist himself, so the flashlight came on and started scanning the field again. After my business was complete, I parked myself beside the fire while my son and uncle done some more investigating. All of a sudden, hands started waving, and the call come here, come here, was told to me. Still afraid and shaken up by the previous experience, I wasn’t too interested in what they were seeing. However, I made my way over to them to see what was going on. But for some reason, I just could not see what they were seeing. “Look there by the tree, see it, see it.” Soon I saw this movement, like an arm sliding down this tree, and behold there it was, a Big Foot. O my God, I could not believe it, there standing beside this White Oak tree this massive creature was standing there with his right arm wrapped around this tree trying to blend in with it I guess. The next morning we went and hunted again, and on our way back to camp, my son and I stopped on what we have named, “Big Foot Ridge,” because every time we hunt there, these Big Foots just will not leave us alone so we can hunt. However, a BFRO expedition was in progress there lead by Ron. My son and I stopped by to see if they were still there and thank God he was. We told him what had happened, he followed back to our campsite and done his own investigation, which included measuring what we had seen, and the creature stood approximately 7’5” All of my life I have heard tales of Big Foots, personal experiences, and never believed that I myself would ever see one, now I have.","classification":"Class A","county":"Reynolds","state":"Missouri"}

There is one road in and about 3-5 miles off the highway.  So I cant imagine anyone out there and if they came down the road we would have heared them unless the walked and it would have been a long walk.  We where all siting around the camp fire talking and something come runing out of the woods.  Just out of the distance of the light of our camp fire and ran down toward the lake.  Where the moon light was the fairly bright.  It ran around that area for awhile almost like it was running circles like it was confused.  It also was waving it arms and making a very strange noise.  Then ran back in the woods. It's appearance was diferent from most that people report.  It was about four feet tall like a baby bigfoot.  It was on two legs and very stalkey and the sounds it made were not like any of the ones on your web sight. A few years back I was whatching a t.v. show that was about bigfoot.  They had some audio of sounds much like the ones you have.  But there was a man in Colaorado that had a recording that was diferent he had it tested by some scientist and he said it was something unexplainable.  But it sounded just like what I herd.

The BFRO investigator eventually spoke with the witness by phone (see investigator's notes below). The witness never typed up the report himself. The friend's version of the story is more or less consistent with the story told by the witness, so it will remain accessible here.] I worked at plant that produces feed grade Amino Acid additives.  Our company is Japanese-owned and had just expanded, adding a new plant to the existing one.  As a shift worker, we work 2 weeks on the day shift, then switch to 2 weeks nights...it's hell on the body's sleep cycle. Anyway, in November of 2000, a fire started in the new plant and as a result, some of the new hires were assigned to work with us in the old plant while their facility was being repaired.  One night, we were sitting in the lunchroom, around midnight, grabbing a bite to eat.  I made the remark about a \"less than helpful\" co-worker to the tune of, \"he's like Bigfoot, occasionally there's a sighting\", eluding to the fact that this particular co-worker had a tendency to hide on midnights and leave all the work to the rest of us.  We all laughed, but one of the new guys got real quiet and his eyes got real big and serious...then he said, in the most serious tone...that sh@% is for real!  We all got very quiet and as we calmed to listen, he told his story. Now this is a guy who was well-liked because he was such a \"crack-up\" which is what you need to have in the manufacturing sector.  He went on to tell the story of how he encountered a Bigfoot when he was on a date in Chafee, Missouri. Him and his girlfriend were parked on a narrow dirt road, just off a county road near Scott City, Missouri.  They were doing what young folks do in a car on friday nights, and when they were ready to leave, they started the car and turned on the headlights.  About 20 yards ahead, they saw a creature, frozen, looking back at them with yellow eyes.  They couldn't turn around due to the narrow lane, so he put it in reverse and backed out about 100 feet to the road and made haste into town.  He said they were so scared, they believed the creature might be on top of their car, that they drove to a convenience store where a group of people were gathered, in the hopes that if people started to scatter, they were correct in their assumption that a Bigfoot was on top of their car. We all sort of laughed at his story, but he remained serious...and I've got to tell you, this seemed strange, because he is normally a very funny guy and his face was quite sullen as he told his story. I sort of believed him and inquired from some of the others as to what they thought. Some say there is a creature in Southeast Missouri known as Yehoo man, so it's not a new phenomenom.  I've been waiting seven years now and noone in this area has posted any reports of sightings here.  I check this site every once in a while and decided to finally tell this story because I believe the young man saw a Bigfoot and I even had him take me out to the location. It happens to be close to a residence, although out in the country, and located close to a stream with trees on both sides of the lane he claimed to be parked in.  It's just another one of those accounts that will probably add to the mystery of what I believe is the last frontier of animal science.","classification":"Class A","county":"Scott","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.286,"longitude":-89.6075,"latlng":"-89.6075,37.286","dewPoint":38.53,"humidity":0.7,"cloudCover":0.62,"moonPhase":0.3,"pressure":1023.7,"weatherSummary":"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.","uvIndex":2,"visibility":9.68,"highTemp":55.27,"midTemp":49.77,"lowTemp":44.27,"windBearing":70,"windSpeed":3.64}
{"id":"1141","timestamp":395539200,"title":"Two six foot tall creatures seen by witness.","observed":"In the summer of 1982, I was 12 years old and went to my first Scout summer camp, near Osceola, Missouri. The entire region is part of the \"Ozarks\" with thousands of square miles of wilderness. One afternoon Myself and another scout were assigned to go to the next camp over, Camp Lonestar, to work on a Tower-Building merit badge. We got tired of this after about 2 hours and decided to walk the 10 miles back to Camp Frontier where my troop was - maybe we'd make it back in time for dinner. We asked one Scoutmaster if there was a shortcut between the camps, he said yes, and pointed us in the right direction. This trail had been used until 1970, when a flood had washed out a bridge. We proceeded about 3 miles down this trail when the forest canopy became so dense, it virtually blocked out almost all sunlight. The foliage on the forest floor was just as dense - someone standing just feet away could be lost to view. Boulders & fallen trees were so thick the trail was soon lost, but we kept going in a Northeast direction, where we thought our camp was. We then heard a crashing sound through the underbrush coming from the Southeast. We stopped to listen & thought it might be a deer, which are common in this area. It was then I saw something that scared the Hell out of me. I saw 2 \"Creatures\" about 6 feet tall, covered in dark brown fur, about 100 feet away from us. They broke out of a thick stand of trees to my left, running faster than any human being could run, over serious obstacles such as large rocks, fallen trees, & thick undergrowth faster than I ever could. They then crossed the path we were about to take about 80 feet in front of me, ran down rocky, log-filled embankment, JUMPED a 10-foot wide stream, and scrabmled up the other side. They then disappeared into the forest on the other side of the stream. I froze with fear, not believing my own eyes. At first I thought I was looking at Chimpanzees, but these things were taller and bigger than me (I was 5'6\" at 12 years old). These things seemed like they were \"racing\" each other much like children do. I saw them for about 10 seconds before they disappeared, and they definitely were bipedal, similar to Human form, and they were swinging their arms over their heads each time they jumped over a large obstacle, just like Hurdlers would in race. There was no way I was going to go any further down this trail no matter what. We were scared out of our minds, and ran back the 4 or 5 miles to the main road as fast as we could. We then hitched a ride from a Scoutmaster back to our camp. When we returned, we told our Scoutmaster everything we saw. He didn't believe us - neither did anyone else. To this day I think of it, knowing that there is no way a human being could run that fast over logs & boulders & down a steep ravine like that in fur suit in 99 degree weather. When I read some of the other sightings in the southern part of Missouri - I know that there are still Unknown primates in that area. For anyone who has ever been in this region, the forests are so thick & there are so many limestone caves, ANYTHING could be hiding there.","classification":"Class A","county":"St. Clair","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.0944,"longitude":-93.5577,"latlng":"-93.5577,38.0944","locationDetails":"Near the H.

My first thought was that I was going to scare up a deer, So I drew my Bow and tried to take aim on the area of movement, But what I saw was not a deer. At first, I thought it was a man in camo laying on the ground, That freaked me out, so I let off my Bow. However, I was trying to make out this \"person\" laying on the ground, on thier belly, When it raised up on it's right arm, turned the upper half of it's body, And looked at me. This was no person.

{"id":"23581","observed":"At the time of this report, I lived in a home located a couple hundred yards from the shores of Tablerock Lake in Stone County, Missouri. Our house was situated at the back of a long cove and uphill from the lake. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains a zone around the Lake in which no development or clearing of land may be done without a permit so as to maintain a natural forested shoreline. The topography of the area is very rugged Ozark mountains and steep terrain. Large tracts of Mark Twain National Forrest make up the area and most land, even private, is still covered by forest. There was much development of homes and home sites taking place in my area at the time. Around the Fall or Winter of 2002 or 2003, myself and my family members began to hear whooping type animal vocalizations originating from a large tract of woods behind our home. The whoops sounded more mammalian then that of a bird and louder than that which would likely be produced by any readily identifiable forest animal. The calls varied, but often were produced as “whoo whoo whoooooop,” with a rise in the pitch on the last whoop. Around the same time, evidence of a mountain lion or cougar’s presence was found. A couple of neighbors, and a family member, had visual sightings of the large cat. I was screamed at once while in the woods and I had found numerous large cat tracts and claw sharpening evidence. Sometimes the cougar would scream in the evening. A few times the cougar’s scream was answered by the whoops or vice versa. On one occasion I was woken up in the middle of the night by the strangest and creepiest howls. They were very loud and the maker of them was moving very rapidly, up an extremely steep mountainside from the lake cove behind my house and was soon beside and then past my house, still moving up the hill and howling/screaming the whole while. I remember laying in bed thinking “what in the world is making that howl”!? I was honestly too frightened to look out my window into the woods to try to catch a glimpse of the maker. It sounded almost evil or malicious if that quality is appropriate to ascribe to a animal’s call. In the spring of 2003 or 2004, while scouting the back of the lake cove for animal evidence, I spotted a large hominid track. I frequently hiked to this area due to the abundance of deer, raccoon and sometimes cougar tracks that were easily identified in the mud. The footprint resembled that of a barefoot human but was approximately 12 or 13 inches in length and maybe 4 inches in width. Very flat footed if I remember correctly. It is possible that it was made by a very large human, but the conditions in which it was discovered caused me to doubt that possibility. It was a single print, but very clear and distinct. I could easy follow the outline of the toes and boundaries of the foot. It must have been made within days of my discovery of it. It was in the muddy washout at the back of the lake cove, where a small stream meets the cove and releases its silt and debris. The distance between the print and either edge of the washout was about 10 feet, yet there was no other prints in the mud of the washout. My own tracks were discernable in the mud of the washout as I walked about but, my own tracks were not near as deep as the print I mentioned. I weighed about 220 lbs at the time. On either side of the washout is a bare rocky shoreline of the lake. It is very difficult and extremely uncomfortable to walk on the sharp and varied sized rocks of that shoreline barefoot. Whatever left the print must have jumped from one shoreline to the middle of the washout, landing on one foot, only leaving the one print, and then bounding off the one foot  in a continuous motion to the other shoreline, landing on the sharp rocks. The distance traversed by the required leap is a distance nearly impossible for any human to accomplish. I also thought it was unlikely, though not impossible, that any human would even be walking barefoot in that area. It was remote. The only time humans venture into that area is during hunting season or to exit a boat to retrieve or relieve something. Because of the stumps, rocks and other obstacles in the cove, it wasn’t likely that any fisherman or boater was that far back in the cove or that they would venture onto the rocky shore or woods barefoot. I later convinced my brother to come look at the print, which he did. We were both simply puzzled by it at the time. I submit this observation for what it’s worth, to the larger collection of possible evidence. The vocalizations and the footprint may have mundane origins. It is possible that all of this was produced by known animals and/or a very large barefoot human, but I don’t want to rule out any options.","classification":"Class B","county":"Stone","state":"Missouri","locationDetails":"."}

My family had just moved from Illinois to Cape Fair, Missouri a few weeks before. Our parents went back to Illinois for a funeral and my sisters (ages 16 & 14) and I (12 years old at the time) were there alone.  It was late at night around 11 or midnight when we all were startled by our dogs barking and growling on the porch.  Normally the dogs would go down to the driveway if they heard something.  This time they stayed on the porch looking towards the front yard barking and growling like I have never heard them do before.  What scared us was that the dogs were scared to go down off the porch. We turned all the lights off in the house and looked out the front windows and door to see if we could see headlights or something outside.  There was a flood light at the corner of the driveway that cast a light on the front yard.  The front yard was all uphill with a 5 ft barbed wire fence separating our yard from the pasture.  The front yard had huge black walnut trees spaced about 30-50 feet apart scattered around.  I was looking out the front window and saw a large figure standing partially behind a walnut tree.  I stared at it a few moments to focus in the dim light to see what it was.  I thought it was maybe a drunk camper who was lost.  You could walk down our back yard to the lake, so I thought maybe someone was looking for a way to the lake through our yard.  People would camp and fish very close by, so we thought somebody was lost.  All around our house it was dense forest and there was only one other house on our 1/2 mile road, so we were very isolated. My 16 yers old sister went to calm the dogs down.  The 14 year old and I were stioll looking out front.  Then after a few moments the figure dashed to the next tree about 50 feet away in about 3 or 4 strides.  I kept looking and before I could ask my 14 yr old sister if she saw that- she ran to the back porch to help my 16 yr old sister with the dogs.  By this time the dogs were freaking out.  Then I looked back to the front yard where I saw it go to another tree, then another tree-zigzagging its way up the hill towards the pasture.  Then to my amazement it cleared the barbed wire fence in one stride and was gone into the night.  My sisters were tending to the dogs so they didn't see all of what I saw.  My 14 year old sister said she saw something by the tree-but she never said anything more than that.  I don't know if they were trying to keep me from getting scared, but I think she saw it too.  I told my parents about it when they got home.  They just blew it off to a city kid seeing \"something\" in the country night.  While I lived there until 1984, I had heard stories of the \"Ozark Mountain Monster\" but thought it was just folklore. I did have several conversations with oldtimers from the area and heard stories of bigfoot sightings over the years, but never had the courage to \"go public\".  I am 37 now and do still believe to this day I saw a bigfoot.  I still get chills when I think about it and am having chills while I am typing this right now.

Date: Late summer (July/August) 1998 Time: 8:30-ish pm My wife and I were living in a small \"park\" trailer (8’x30’) on our 10-acre lot just north of Forsyth, Missouri. The area is isolated, almost entirely undeveloped, and composed of heavily forested 10-acre lots. Access to the area was at that time a rather narrow dirt/gravel road which was barely able to handle two-way traffic. The area supports a variety of wildlife including possum, raccoons, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, and a large deer population. Black bears, small and scraggly, are relatively rare, but are reportedly making a comeback in the area and appear to be moving from Arkansas to the south. Both my wife and I had been to work very early in the day, and were quite tired. We were lying in our bedroom at the western end of the trailer with the windows open, reading before turning in for the night. We had small reading lamps turned on; there was still some light outside, but the sun had just dropped below the horizon/trees. We suddenly heard a long, drawn-out scream that was very reminiscent of a woman in fear or pain. Our two dogs began barking fiercely and jumping against their compound fence behind our trailer. The long cry was repeated, this time with an upward shift in tone toward the end, and I was reminded of the call of a peacock. I asked my wife what she thought it was, and did it sound like a peacock. She used to work at an amusement park where peacocks roamed freely, and she said that it was most definitely not a peacock call. When the scream sounded a third time both of us immediately came to the conclusion that someone was in trouble, and we headed for the door. I carried a big, multi-cell flashlight and went out the front door (facing south), while my wife stayed by the door, telephone in hand, prepared to dial 9-1-1 should the need arise. The only clearing that we had done on the entire property was the long driveway back to our trailer site, the actual clearing needed for the trailer itself, and the small amount of additional land clearing that was required for a well house (and access by the well-drillers for their large trucks). I moved westward, perhaps 100 feet, to the far side of the driveway clearing. There are no street lights in the area and with the sun already below the horizon darkness was falling rapidly. I shone the beam of the flashlight across the forested area from which the scream had come, sweeping it slowly left and right. There was a shuffling noise about 50 feet further west amidst a stand of several large cedars and oak trees. I swung the light to the spot where the sound seemed to originate and a dark shape moved behind the biggest of the trees. At the extreme range of the light beam I was alarmed to see two red/orange reflected eyes looking directly at me. No other details were apparent except for generic dark shadow. The two eyes were at a point well above the expected face height for a normal adult human. They blinked once or twice, then vanished as if the owner either closed them fully or turned away. It was growing darker by the second and the only clearly visible area was the cleared driveway and the partially cleared walk to the trailer. All else was in deep shadow. The shuffling noise came again, and a vague shadow moved quickly toward the southwest from behind the trees where I had seen the eyes. I attempted to use the flashlight to see the owner of the eyes, but could only see a tall shadow. It moved at a run, upright, and I initially thought it must be a tall, heavy-set man. I was still thinking that the screams had come from a female and that this must be her attacker. However, there was no one else in the area at the time. The 10-acre lots to the east and west of ours were unoccupied and completely undeveloped. While there is one house to the south, across the access road, it is set back from the road and was dark; the occupants were not home at the time. There were no further calls, screams, or noises in the forest, and our dogs ceased jumping against the fence, but continued to bark and wine in an agitated manner for another 10-15 minutes. I returned to the house and reported what I’d seen to my wife. Without additional information we decided that a call to 9-1-1 was not advisable. Within a week we were attending a gathering of the Ozark Mountain Indian Heritage Association (OMIHA) and recounted the incident to several of the men in the group. More than one described having experienced similar encounters with such an \"animal,\" and one man in particular mentioned that he had actually attempted to give chase with his hunting dogs. The dogs got fairly close to where he suspected the \"animal\" was hiding but then returned to him, tails tucked and whining, refusing to pursue it further. He, too, noted that the eyes reflected red/orange in a flashlight. After that I made it a habit to have a fully loaded Marlin 30-30 by the bedside, but the incident was never repeated; we have not seen or heard anything similar since the original incident. The area is now more populated, all the lots having been sold/occupied, and several of the neighbors have free-roaming dogs. The deer and coyote population is either greatly reduced or they have gone elsewhere to avoid the neighbors’ dogs. We still have possum and raccoons, but they, too, are far less frequent to the area. Note: The air was still; no wind. I did not detect any unusual scents, although there was obviously enough for our two dogs to detect as they were highly agitated.","classification":"Class B","county":"Taney","state":"Missouri"}

On the right side of the road there are some farm buildings, with a row of cedar trees planted right along the right-of-way. As I descended the hill, I saw a large, dark creature above the roadside.  It was upright and appeared to be covered in hair.  It was walking towards the cedar trees, and dodged into them as I approached.  My impression was it was over 6' in height, and rather broad through the chest. This would have been sometime around 6:30 in the morning, and there was only early sun.  Shadows were present as well, but I know I saw something.  It moved! When I got to work I mentioned my experience to a couple co-workers, and got a long razzing about it.  I pretty much shut up about it after that. On the way home that evening, I stopped of at the place where I saw \"it\".  There was no evidence of footprints, but some of the leaves and grass were stirred up as if something had come through there.  In comparing my height to the adjacent cedar trees, I also reaffirmed my belief in \"it's\" height.  It had to have been over 6' tall. There are/were bears in southern Missouri, but not as large as what I saw.  Also I don't think a bear can walk upright and take large strides.

I had a Missouri Licence for deer and got up long before dawn to go deer hunting. I went across the river into Missouri long before daylight at Leavenworth. It had snowed about a inch or two between 3 and five in the morning. I went north on a gravel road on the Missouri side of the river. It was fresh snow and no tracks but mine, evan on the gravel road. There was a field a few miles north about 1/2 mile across or so that led to the woods along the river. I got there before daylight. There were no tracks from anyone or anything. It was a fresh snow, not over a couple hours old. I walked to the edge of the woods along the river and found footprints that made me look like a little kid when I put my boot in them. It was like a barefoot person with really big feet. I tracked him for a little ways. He had come out of the wood to the edge of a river bottom field and walked along the egde of the woods, then backtracked himself in the edge of the woods to where if anything were following him they would go right by him. He then bent over some smaller willows and ate the bark off off them. From there he went back into the really thick stuff along the river. I did not attempt to follow.

We were so excited that we couldn't wait, so we moved in on Christmas Day.  There were only two bedrooms in the back of the house, which were claimed by my parents and younger brother.  I was happy enough with a \"study\" in the front of the house, which had very large windows on two sides, practically covering the entire wall area.  Because of the unusual size and shape of the windows, we didn't have anything immediately to cover them, but we weren't concerned because we were in a secluded area off the road and woods all around.  Also, the front side of the house where my room was located, was on a slope, so no one could walk right up and actually see into my room without a ladder.  When I woke up that first morning in my new room, I was excited to see the beautiful layer of snow all around the wooded yard.  I was startled, though, to see a set of footprints coming from the back of the house, from the woods.  The footprints came up along the side of the house and then circled around to my front window.  I told my parents immediately, and my dad went out to investigate.  The footprints were huge, like twice the size of my dad's foot in width and almost twice as big in length.  My dad dismissed it as someone walking through the woods with boots on and not worried because the windows were too high for someone to see into.  The shape was not right for a boot, though. I would have dismissed that completey except that the early summer of 1981 , another incident occurred which my mom, brother and I have never been able to forget or quite reconcile.  We were standing outside at dusk.  My uncle had just dropped by to check on us because my dad had been away on a trip.  He had just driven out of our driveway and we turned to walk back inside.  There was an eery feeling and we all noticed how there was silence.  No crickets chirping or frogs croaking, or other usual evening animal sounds.  Then a monstrous roar came from the darkness of the woods behind us.  No one said a word, we just all three took off running for the front door.  I still get goosebumps when I think about that sound.  I've never heard anything like it in real life ever before or since.  It sent a chill of fear right to my core.  It was deep, and long and powerful.  My uncle did return an hour later and looked around the house with a flashlight.  He didn't see or hear anything.

I was sitting in the back of an old Chevy Citation at the time it was pretty new, my uncle was driving and my aunt was in the passenger seat and my little cousin who was around 4 or 5 at the time was sitting in the back with me, were coming home and I believe from visiting family or something.  My aunt & uncle lived down this old dirt road around 2 miles and right before their driveway which was on the left was and old dry branch or creek that ran across the road and it did not have a concrete slab to cross over it so you had to slow down a little to cross.  Directly to the right of the creek was an old driveway leading to an old abandoned house which no one had lived in for years.  It was dark so naturally we had the headlights on and as my uncle began slowing to pass over the rough gravel something in the corner of my right eye came into view.  My aunt kind of screamed but not loudly because we were amazed and terrified.  Something that looked to be around 8 foot tall, (I know as a 10-11 year old kid it was huge) came across the branch which led out of the old driveway and not running but walking briskly came directly in front the car.  We all just stared as it was some dream.  It was swinging it's arms a little and acted like we were not even there.  It walked across the creek and crossed the water gate which I don't remeber if it went under or over but what I do remeber is the branch had washed out the bank of my uncle's yard and his perimter fence was quite tall if you were staning in the branch and this bright red haired thing jumped over from the bed of the branch like nothing and into my uncles yard.  Mind you were still watching in the car.  We could see it walk up thru the yard and up the hill until we lost sight of it with the headlights.  My uncle turned into the drive and we had all locked the doors.  My aunt and uncle went thru the count of 3 thing and we open the doors and ran inside.  We got inside and my uncle got his hunting rifle out and went outside with his flood lite and looked for it and on his way back which he didn't walk far he tripped on the chord and it came unplugged then he yelled and got up and ran into the house and locked the door.  To this day if you ask him about what he saw he will say he saw something but he doesn't know what it was or that somebody was playing a joke on us.  My aunt will tell that she saw bigfoot and so will I.  My little cousin was to small to remeber much but I remeber and to this day I don't go out into the woods without a weapon.  To the best of my ability this is what it looked like.  It was around 7-8 foot tall, completly covered in red hair and 1 feature I remember is it looked like it's arms were almost as long as it's legs and that it was not afraid of us.  Also at that time there was a man I do not remember but lived in the area and was at the local store there in Souder, Mo. and was telling everyone he had seen bigfoot and no one believed him so none of us ever made much mention to it except to family or close friends.  But I believe.

I would say it was 7.5'-8' tall and 350-400 pounds.  I'm not sure of the color since it was dark. I would say it was dark brown, but the moonlight and limited visibility gave it's coat a whiteish sheen. The vehicle I was driving was a 'lifted' pickup truck.  I was able to see eye-to-eye with it. The creature appeared to be much taller than the vehicle, but it was either squatting slightly or hunched down a bit. It had very broad shoulders, much larger than anything I had ever seen. They were close to 3' across. I looked right into it's face and it's eyes were a deep black.

I was on my way home from a friends house on my bike about to head up the hill. I heard something off in the woods to my left and looked to see what it was. I was very used to being in the woods, having grown up around them all my life. I expected to see a deer or some other type of wildlife that I was so familiar with. But, I turned and saw what I still believe was bigfoot. It was a little less than a hundred yards away, and walking perpendicular to me. The strides that it took were amazing, so fluid. There was no real bobbing of the head like I have heard of from other sightings, and the arms didn't swing out as much as others have reported, it was very human like. It's body was covered in a brown hair, not a very dark brown though. It was more the color sandstone, that's the best thing I can think of to compare the color. I watched it walk for about a minute, I was to scared to move at all, so I was just kind of frozen there watching it. Then it stopped right beside a large birch tree. I was afraid that it had seen me and didn't know what it would do, so I turned to look up the hill and contemplate running up the hill towards my house or to turn and run back to my friends house. I decided that I was going to leave my bike and run back to my friends since it wasn't up hill to his house. I turned to look back and see where the creature was at and couldn't see it anymore. I believe it hid behind the large birch that it stopped beside. That's when I ran, I was so scared I just ran to my friends house and didn't even knock, I just ran inside and told them what had happened.

Immediately afterwards the walking stopped and I called out again as I began walking towards this little dirt road that separated our back yard from the woods. At this point it sounded as though the footsteps were coming towards me. Not wanting to shoot someone accidentally and still wanting to be safe I went back to the dog kennel and let out our red heeler who I add is usually fearless. I told her come \"come\" and began walking back towards the woods, the dog ran up to the treeline ears pointing up and alert and immediately ran back to her cage. I have never seen that dog back down from anything before or since so I yelled out one more time for whoever was out there that I was armed and to leave now.

I was about 6 or 7 years old and my younger sister and I were looking out our living room window and saw a big hairy ape-like creature walking upright. It walked across our yard and into the woods.  It looked like it came across the road from the angle it was walking but we didn't see it cross.  We didn't see until it was almost to the side of the house, it was only about 100 feet away from us and we got a good look at it.  I still live in the same house where this happened.  It was dusk but still bright enough outside to see well.  It looked right at us and of course it scared us at the time.  We told our mom but she didn't believe us, but to calm us she told us to hide in the bathroom. So we did.  It's hair was a dark redish brown but the red tint could of been from the sun going down. It was about 6'6\" or so, tall, stocky, broad shouldered, hairy, and naked.  It was not human, it had way too much hair for that. Most people in the area do not act too surprised when sasquatch are mentioned. I hope you can prove their existance for good but I hope that they don't get harmed in the prossess.

{"id":"36247","observed":"My husband and I were watching a movie in his brother's barn,  where we have set up a movie projector and screen.  It was during the last half of the second movie, when we started hearing loud splashing noises coming from the lake, not far from the opening of the barn door, where we were sitting.  My husband asked if I heard that, and I said \"yeah, it is probably fish jumping, or maybe a raccoon or something.\" We continued to watch the movie, still hearing loud splashing noises.  As the splashing continued,  it sounded too big and noisy to be fish jumping.  It sounded like something large walking along the shore.  When the movie was over, my husband went up into the loft of the barn to disconnect the projector and computer.  I stood at the barn entrance,  trying to see out towards the lake and see if I could see anything.  While trying to peer out into the dark,  I suddenly felt very uneasy,  like I was being watched.  The hairs at the back of my neck stood up, and I said to my husband \"I really want to you to come back down here!!\"  Now,  I keep horses at my brother-in-laws place, and I am out there all the time, all hours of the day and night.  I am very familiar with this property and the surrounding area, and have never felt uneasy like that before. When my husband came back down,  I handed him a small flashlight and asked him to shine the light down towards where the splashing noises were coming from.  He took the flashlight and walked down to the water's edge.  When he started walking towards the water, the noises stopped.  Then he shined the flashlight and there was nothing.  I was watching still from the barn.  After a second or two,  I heard the noises further down to my right.  When my husband would shine the light, the noises would stop,  then continue in a different area of the lakeshore.  He came back to the barn and said he wasn't sure what was going on, but that it \"definitely was not normal.\"  We both felt a little creeped out, and decided to go home. The next morning, I went to the barn to take care of my horses, and decided to look around the lake shore area and see if I could find any tracks or evidence of what was going on down there.  I came across a very large footprint!!  I stood there staring at it for a few minutes, trying to figure out if I was really looking at what I thought I was looking at.  It looks human in shape, but very large.  My husband wears a size 14 mens, and it was much bigger than his foot.  There were other prints that appeared to be partial, like a heel impression,  a half footprint, etc.  But this one was the only one that I could not reason off as anything else but perhaps a Bigfoot footprint!

I was at a 5 mph rolling stop when I looked where the rabbit had run from and I saw a 7 to 8 foot tall ape like animal running on it's hind legs at my vehicle as if it were aggressively charging at me. I did not get a look at it's face other than the clear outline of the creature. I was very frightened at the site, and the sense of knowing it was an animal not native to Missouri, and it had just made me start to reconsider what I had just seen.

{"id":"24767","timestamp":690163200,"title":"Motorist recalls possible early morning sighting north of Mt. Vernon","observed":"After reading the FAQ section, I have finally decided to tell someone of my \"sighting\". I am not saying for sure it was a bigfoot, but after reading the article you posted about   the young bigfoot caught on a game cam that some people say was \"just a bear\" made me realize that what I saw may have been a young bigfoot. My sighting was actually \"the near miss with a car\" experience. I am honestly not positive of the year, but it was near 1991 or 92. I was driving home from work, alone, about 1am. I had just turned onto the road I lived off of and was going down the first hill. Half way down, something ran across the road in front of me. I hit my brakes, natural instinct, barely missing it I was sure, and then I kept going.  It was merely seconds, but I knew what I saw was not something normal. It was on all fours, but the body and head seemed parallel to the ground, unlike the bears I have seen in zoos. (They seem to have a downward slope from their hip to their head.) The body was not large at the back half but evenly proportioned. The legs seemed to be easily defined. Not real thick at the top tapering down. The only way I can describe it would be that the legs came from the hip, no flap of skin coming from the belly region to the leg to make them look bigger at the body and it seemed the bending when it ran came from the hip and knee area. The thing that has bothered me all these years, the one thing I knew that separates this from your typical animal was the head. It was the way it looked in my direction as it ran. 1) In my experience, most animals running across the road like that don't even look at you.  2) What has bothered me the most, and I couldn't put my finger on til recently, was when it looked in my direction, it didn't turn it's head \"normally\". It brought it's head up a little, but it turned it sideways to see! (picture yourself on all fours, looking at the floor. Without lifting your head, look to the left. That is how it looked my way.) I did see two eyes and a mouth, it happened too quick to get a detailed look , but I saw a face, a face that did NOT have an extended snout. Lighter colored than the rest of the brown colored body. It seemed hairless, but again, I can't be positive how hairless it was. I had a radio on, so if there was anything to hear, I didn't hear it. The next day I drove past where I saw it and saw no signs of anything. Not then , or since then. I am from Muscatine, Iowa originally. We lived not too far from the river, right beside the levee actually, and back in the seventies there seemed to be a migratory path going thru the area. I recall hearing about an encounter with a neighbors dog, and going fishing at night only to be loaded very quickly back up into the truck by dad to leave the area because of large branches breaking in the woods. But in all the stories I have heard, I never realized that a young bigfoot is known to run on all fours so I never made the connection until I read your website. I have always assumed they walk on two legs all the time.","classification":"Class B","county":"Lawrence","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.19201,"longitude":-93.73122,"latlng":"-93.73122,37.19201","locationDetails":"Directions omitted upon wtiness' request","dewPoint":55.28,"humidity":0.88,"cloudCover":0.92,"moonPhase":0.29,"pressure":1017.44,"weatherSummary":"Foggy overnight.","uvIndex":2,"visibility":4.94,"highTemp":64.91,"midTemp":57.035,"lowTemp":49.16,"precipitationIntensity":0.0022,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":203,"windSpeed":3.4}

I owned three dogs at this time, two hounds and a squirrel dog. They turned up missing for about three days. On the night of that third day I had a wind-up alarm clock set inside of a washpan because I was so hard to wake up. Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. my wife shook me awake saying the dogs must be back. She heard some growling noise real close to the house. When I heard the noise, I told my wife \"that ain’t no dog\". It was the weirdest growling sound I ever heard. I jumped out of bed so fast I hit the dishpan and it went across the floor and made a lot of racket. I looked out the window through the window screen and there was what must have been a bigfoot creature of some sort. It was not a bear. It was a very moonlit night, so I know I couldn’t mistake a bear for something else. And it was not human! It was covered in long wavy hair on its body, but much less hair around the facial area. It had a humanlike face and yet it wasn’t human. Suddenly it turned its head (not its body) just its head and just stared in my direction. I started to feel a panic coming on, but I knew I had to do something. I raced to get my shotgun, ran out the front door. I was sure I could reach the yard in time. But it was gone, even though there shouldn’t have been time for it to past the clearing of the yard. So I fired the shotgun into the air just in case it was still close by.

When we got to the place out of town. I took off by myself down the road towards the East back to Route 70 to wait. I had been walking for about 25-30 minutes when the wind shifted from the South. I smelled something awful a cross between a skunk and rotten flesh, like something died. As I was walking along the South side of the road I noticed someone walking about 300-400 feet away along the edge of the woods on the South side of pasture. I thought it was kind of late for a farmer to be bringing his cows in as they were in a big hurry to get away from him. About that time I heard a God Awful blood curdling scream which I thought was the cattle screaming. I stopped to look accross at the farmer and he also stopped and stood still looking at me, which I considered odd. As I continued East I watched as he matched my every move and would stop and stare when I did. The cows were gone buy now and the stench was getting stronger as what I thought was a man angeled his way closer to me. I stopped and stared right at the thing ( at that point I knew it was not a man as it was only walking and I was almost running ) it was coming straight for me. It stood close to eleven foot tall and was covered with thick matted redish brown hair. I took off running as fast as I could for the next light down the road. It was a long way off, and as I looked over my shoulder it stepped over a four foot high barbed wire fence with out touching the wire. I knew I was in trouble. I ran for the far away farm house as fast as I could go. My adrenalin going and was scared out of my wits. As I approached the fence to get to the house towards the South, I realized that not only was the house much farther then I thought, but I was met by a pack of farm dogs at the gate. As I jumped the gate ( I don't even think my feet touched the gate ) into the pack of dogs I didn't dare look back. I ran to the home of a farmer and pounded on the door but the farmer would not open the door. I looked at the farmer and I could tell he had seen the creature by the terrified and confused look on his face. I was so scared that I sat down on the porch in a ball and waited for the creature to leave. When I looked up the creature was headed towards the same pasture it had come from with the dogs chasing after it. That was the last I saw of it. I ran and hid behind a tree until my friend joined me. I did not tell my friend what had happened.

{"id":"24404","timestamp":-76550400,"title":"Woman recalls a very close encounter as a child on a farm near the Mark Twain National Forest","observed":"Many times I have tried to write about this major event in my life, but I find it difficult to tell it just like it happened.  It seems as though I have missed many details. I do not like to relive the event.   Since I can never forget it, I might as well share it with you. I was born and raised on a farm about ten miles from the nearest town in the Ozarks.  The farm had a wooded area that was connected to The Mark Twain National Forest.  I had a neighbor friend that I played with as a child. She lived about a half mile down a gravel road where we would walk back and forth to each others homes. That summer I was twelve years old.  It was a summer evening, and I had walked up to my friend’s house playing. It would soon be dusk and time for me to go home.  I had been taught to watch out for snakes and I kept an eye out for wild animals.  It was starting to turn dusk just as the old gravel road dropped off into a hollow.  It was always a few shades darker in the hollow as both sides of the road were lined with trees and foliage acting as a canopy. I guess I was not paying as much attention as I knew I should have been.  I was watching out for the snakes because the hollow always seemed to have more than its share.  My dad had hunting dogs and one always followed us around.  I could smell the dog.  It smelled liked it had been down in the pond again.  I could hear it walking along with me, just a few feet off, in the woods.  I started calling the dog to come to me, but it did not respond.  I thought this was odd.  The road was coming up out of the hollow, and I started to pay more attention to what was happening.  I could finally hear the dog coming toward me.  It stepped out of the woods onto the gravel road, to my right and just behind me.   The hair on my neck started to crawl.  Something was not right and I could feel it.  I looked down and a little to my right, expecting to see the dog but all I saw was two huge hairy feet.  Suddenly, I turned my head back toward the road and froze in my tracks.  My feet became rooted in the ground as a wave of fear washed over me.   My mouth was as dry as a bone. I could not have uttered a word;   Even though I was so frightened I could not help myself, I had to look.  I had to see what was standing next to me.  I slowly turned to my right again but this time I looked over my shoulder, right into a hairy body.  It was within arm’s reach.  As I lifted my eyes, they traveled up, up as it was very tall;  I saw nipples under a reddish  thick hair, it was not fur. Finally I was looking into a face.  It was watching me very closely.  The whites of the eyes were reddish and its pupils were a bluish color. I looked away and down at my feet. I did not know how I was going to get away from this creature.  It was tall and stocky built. It could have killed me had it wanted to.   I put one foot out slowly and walked as though I had rocks tied to my feet.  The distance from where I first saw the creature and home seem like an eternity.    At last I was to the door of home.   My body was so tense it hurt to move.  I was so afraid but knew I had to look to check where it was.   It was still behind me. I could not allow this thing to enter into my home so I slowly turned my head to look behind me.   I had only turned a little when I saw it standing down the drive a short ways.  There was a cedar tree along the driveway and its hand was close to the top of the tree.  It still watched me and then it just dropped its hand and in about three strides disappeared into the forest.   I then cried out.   It must have been a strange or horrible scream because my dad came running.  I could hardly talk to tell him about what had happen.   He knew something had happened so he got his rifle and searched around the house.   Dusk was falling fast when he returned.   I was so relieved to see him return safe.   He started trying to calm me down and reassure me.   His tried to convince me it could be a bear because everything can be explained.   And maybe I should not repeat it to anyone else.  I know he was only trying to protect me by his words.   It took two years to finally have an idea what it was that I encountered.   Then a TV program came on “The Legend of Sasquatch”.       Then my dad said, “Sis, is that what you saw a few years ago?”     I said, “Close enough.” I have spent a lot of sleepless nights since that awful evening and I have thought of what happened and I wonder what would have happened if I would have reacted differently.","classification":"Class A","county":"Howell","state":"Missouri","latitude":36.97061,"longitude":-92.09264,"latlng":"-92.09264,36.97061","locationDetails":"Near Noblett Lake","dewPoint":67.19,"humidity":0.69,"cloudCover":0.19,"moonPhase":0.78,"pressure":1013.58,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":8.14,"highTemp":89.07,"midTemp":80.215,"lowTemp":71.36,"windBearing":228,"windSpeed":3.73}

{"id":"43612","timestamp":302313600,"title":"Woman recalls encounter she had as a youth on rural property north of Bethany","observed":"I was visiting my Father and Grandparents during a summer school break. I was about 11 years old at the time. (It has been many years since my sighting; about 34 yrs. ago to be exact, but I remember it vividly as it was very traumatic). My Father’s home was in Ridgeway, MO and my grandparents lived about a mile away.  The area consists of vast farmland with many creeks, ponds and heavily forested areas in between. It is a very rural area with a sparse population. I was fishing alone at a pond that was located very near to my Father’s home. The sun was just starting to set, so I decided that it was time to quit and go inside. The pond was encircled with barbed wire and posts for the cows. I put my tackle box and fishing rod through the fence first and then climbed on top of the post to go over the fence myself. Just as I climbed on top of the post to jump over, I heard a loud roar/yell “Raaaah” and looked to see where it was coming from.  There is thick wood land that is on the edge of the property; probably about 100 yards away.  I spotted something on the edge of the wood line as I was on the fence post.   I was shocked at what I was seeing. I immediately knew that it was not a man, but an animal, standing on two legs upright when I saw it. It was standing just outside the edge of the wood line and had roared. It then had its elongated arms raised above its head and waving them from side to side, which it appeared to be alerting me that it was there.  It looked more man-like in face and body, but I knew it wasn’t a man. It was very tall, much taller than a normal man, muscular but thin, with sparse hair covering its body and partial face. The face appeared to be long with a pronounced forehead. The flesh that was visible appeared to be flesh tone and grayish in color. I could see skin through the fur/hair. The hair color was a brownish color with what looked like varying lengths, but very thin.  I only observed it for about 20-30 seconds as I was scared to death. The way that the property is situated is the house in the center, pond that I was fishing in to the right of the house and the wood line to the left of the house.   I had to run toward the house; which was also toward the wood line to escape inside. As I ran, I was too scared to see where the thing was and just made a beeline (tunnel vision) to the door. We never locked our doors there, but as soon as I got inside, I locked all the doors. My father asked me why I was doing this and I didn’t want to tell him as I thought they wouldn’t believe me. That night, I slept in my room on the floor in between the bed against the wall as I was so afraid. I left the next morning for my Mother’s home in Kansas City, MO. I was never so grateful to leave in my life. I had returned to Ridgeway for subsequent visits over the years and I made sure that I was never alone outside again after that sighting. My Father has since moved and Grandparents have passed away. I have not been there since 1986. I would love to go back one day and perhaps try to see it again. There was a small, old non-maintained cemetery that was between my Father and Grandparent’s home.  The wooded area is very dense.  I frequently walked the mile in between my Father and Grandparent’s homes.  Many times on the way, I would stop at the cemetery; which was overgrown with trees, grass and vines and look at the old headstones, many dated back to the 1800’s so I was fascinated. On many occasions I had heard something large moving nearby and always felt like I was being watched. I always thought it was due to the location that I was in, but after my sighting, I could not go there again with or without someone else. I have told my story over the years many times to my husband, and he has been watching BFRO for about a year now and he convinced me to write this report of my sighting for documentation. I carried my secret sighting for many years before I mentioned it to anyone for fear of disbelief.","classification":"Class A","county":"Harrison","state":"Missouri","latitude":40.39956,"longitude":-94.02478,"latlng":"-94.02478,40.39956","locationDetails":"Harrison County around Ridgeway, MO","dewPoint":63.26,"humidity":0.73,"cloudCover":0.42,"moonPhase":0.27,"pressure":1015.54,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy until evening.","uvIndex":7,"visibility":8.31,"highTemp":80.3,"midTemp":72.865,"lowTemp":65.43,"precipitationIntensity":0.0001,"precipitationProbability":0.36,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":347,"windSpeed":4.55}
{"id":"2036","timestamp":581126400,"title":"Multiple witnesses encounter bad smell, three observe creature hiding behind sapling","observed":"On a real nice night in June about 9:30p.m. myself and some other guys were talking after a softball game on what we wanted to do. So one of the guys suggested that we go to the \"old resort\" to see if anybody was partying there. The old resort was a abandoned piece of land that had a strectch of driveway from a road that went over a hill down a low part and up again. And on top of that second hill was a old empty in-ground swimming pool and a couple of small collapsed buildings. I havenever been there before but heard of others talking about having a \"kegger\" there a time or two. So we all loaded up in Dave's van and off we went, there were 6 or 7 of us. When we arrived there we went over a gate down the hill and up the 2nd hill to the old resort. No one was there but I wanted to see this place for myself, the moon was real bright and your eyes adjusted real well to the lighting conditions and after about 20 min. of \"exploring \" we decided to head back to the van. Now there was 2 guys ahead of us, myself Mike and Gene, and 3 guys in back of us, at about a distance of 25 feet between each of the groups. The two others that were walking with me was Mike and Gene, I'm about 6' 3\" and Gene is about 6' 5\" and Mike was short. As we were walking west towards the van in between the two hills with woods on both sides of the path back to the road. I started to smell the worse odor that wasn't chemically produced. Something like real bad B.O., musky like and fecal. At that point I said \"Gene, what is that smell ? \" and Gene said \"It ain't a skunk but it's just as bad.\" Thats when Mike stopped in his tracks and began looking at our right .We stopped as well and Gene looked where Mike was and said \"Oh my god, look!\"   I looked and saw a figure about 20' from our location staring right back at us. Couldn't make out facial features because the moon was behind it but it stayed behind some brush just checking us out. I looked ahead of us and the guys in front were there and looked behind me and those guys was acounted for also. I said \"What is that?\" and Gene said \"I don't know but I can't handle this!\"  Off he went with me and Mike.  After him passing by the guys in front and when Gene got to the gate he climbed it with 2 steps and didn't stop until he got to the van. I know this because I was right behind him. We waited for the rest and told them what happened. Then I began to rationalize that maybe we just smelled a dead animal and maybe it was just a cedar tree swaying in the breeze. So Dave and I went back to the spot and there was no smell and no tree at the spot where I saw it. Whatever we saw was taller than both Gene and I by about a good half foot.","classification":"Class A","county":"Greene","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.07354,"longitude":-93.13545,"latlng":"-93.13545,37.07354","locationDetails":"Wooded area near Lake Sprinfield, which is connected with James River","dewPoint":61.2,"humidity":0.71,"cloudCover":0.77,"moonPhase":0.54,"pressure":1014.75,"weatherSummary":"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.","uvIndex":7,"visibility":8.07,"highTemp":82.93,"midTemp":70.575,"lowTemp":58.22,"precipitationIntensity":0.0033,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":155,"windSpeed":5.02}

Between the time I was 14 and 18 from 1950 to 1954 we used to hear the most hair raising screams every so often.They usually come from a forest behind a 4 acre rye field that was just behind our house.First time I heard it, ma and I was cleanen up after buchering a hog.We heard the most God awfull screams coming down from Fry ridge behind our house.The hair went up on the back of my neck and we had 6 coonhounds, and there hair stood up like brillo pads and they run under the smokehouse.Dad laffed it off when we told him but later that night when he was out feedin the chickens it happened again.He come runnin in the house yellin, Did you hear that? Is that what you heard? Man ,he must have some lungs. Another time I was 16 and walking home from my uncles on a pitch black night when I heard that scream up the road between me and home.I froze cause I didn't want to turn around and go a half mile back to my uncles.But I heard the screams again, getting closer.  I jumped a fence into our pasture where we had about 20 head of black anguses and run like hell, couldnt see anything and run right into one of our cows.I fell down into the mud and nearly got trampeled because the cows were running all over the pasture.We heard the screams many times over the years and the neighbors would often talk about it.They always called it, that panthercat. We never heard anyone say theyd actually seen this panthercat or found his tracks.

They live just down the road from me. A friend of mine had asked me to drive her to Montana at that time, so we left and I was gone for at least a week.  When I returned, it was around 11:00 at night somewhere around the first part of October 2000. I parked my truck down next to the barn area and walked up towards the house.  Off to my immediate right I heard this hair raising guttural growl.  My mind was racing...was this one of my nephews bull cows, or was it a deer, but none of those fit anything like that sound. I thought my feet would never get me to the door of the house. This sound was done once again. I finally went in and told my family what I had heard. My son-in-law insisted that it must have been a bear. I have hunted all of my life and know all of the animal sounds, including a bear. The next morning I called the Conservation office, and they put a gentleman on the phone and I related to him what had happened. I even made a similance of the sound the best I could. He said that he and his wife go to Alaska all the time to study bear and he had never heard anything like that and it definitely wasn't a bear. The next night, my other daughter and I were upstairs getting ready for bed around 11:00 p.m again and had the windows open. I heard the same sound again out my bedroom window. I quickly turned out the lights, and my daughter crawled from her room to mine to see if she could also hear it. By then, the sound had stopped. Several days later in the eveming, my grandaughter, grandson, and I believe another grandson were playing outside the garage door which was raised up about 3 feet. They heard this loud guttural sound also very close to the same place I had heard it originally and rolled under the garage door as fast as possible. Since that time, several of my family have had some very scary encounters with this sound near their houses. We live in a very wooded cedar and hardwood area with a year round creek. I would like to relate all of these incidents, but they are fairly numerous. I would be glad to tell you, and introduce you to the ones who have had these various experiences. These creatures have lived in this area for many years. My youngest son who is in college now, was out hunting with his friend. They were both about 11 years old at the time, and were hunting up a powerline when they saw what they thought was person, but realized it had hair on it like a gorilla, and it was shaking a fairly good sized cedar tree, which we assume it was trying to shake something out of it. They both turned and left the woods very quickly.","classification":"Class B","county":"Franklin","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.40685,"longitude":-90.7,"latlng":"-90.7,38.40685","locationDetails":"[Details removed by witness request]","dewPoint":50.86,"humidity":0.76,"cloudCover":0.46,"moonPhase":0.12,"pressure":1020.15,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy throughout the day.","uvIndex":4,"visibility":9.65,"highTemp":68.43,"midTemp":59.05,"lowTemp":49.67,"precipitationIntensity":0.0005,"precipitationProbability":0.2,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":154,"windSpeed":2.42}
{"id":"29980","timestamp":341452800,"title":"Hunter remembers his lengthy daylight sighting through binoculars near Dora","observed":"I was out early in the morning just after daylight looking for buck sign and squirrel hunting.Mainly looking for rubs and scrapes for deer hunting the upcoming season.I was on a hillside overlooking a steep canyon in rough country on the bryant creek watershed.I sit for a spell and was watching the other hillside.I was carrying a browning bottom eject 22 rifle and had planned to harvest squirrels but had passed on several in hope of not alarming deer in the area..I saw a flicker of movement on the adjecent hillside about 150 yds distance.I unlooped my Nikon binoculars from around my neck and looked over where I saw the leaves move.Even though it was late october and a cool morning it hadnt frosted yet and the leaves were mostly green.What I saw was a small sapling move.I saw black fur probably a foot sized patch through the foliage.It was standing still at this point.I thought bear or maybe a cow and was unconcerned.It finally took a few steps and I gasped when I realized it was a upright animal and covered in black fur.It was a dusky black and not shiny.It was moving parallel on the hill and angling somewhat upwards.Id say I watched it for about 10 mins and had never fuly got a look at it even through the binoculars but it finaly hit a small vehicle sized opening and It hit me I was actually watching a bigfoot.It was feeding on something on the ground I believe wild grapes that had fell out of a tree that had vines in it or maybe acorns.It would occasionally look up and listen.A car went down the highway about a half mile in the distance and it looked up and was canting its head to listen.I believe if the car had turned down the gravel road towards us it would have fled.It was only when the car went quiet a ways down the road it continued to feed.It was very large probably 7 foot plus and very broad shouldered.It elbows wasnt like humans it was pointed and stuck back like a deers front leg even when relaxed.It had a crown or slight dome on top its head.A dusky charcoal black with silver beginning at the back of the head and a ridge of fur beginning to get thicker there and widening as it came down the back.The hairs in the elbows and down the back of the leg was longer and the stripe of heavier hair down the head and back was silver tipped.It was somewhat pot bellied but not really.The upper body was absolutely massive.I wouldnt hesitate to say the animal weighed 400 lbs in the least.The nose must have been flat because it didnt make but maybe a half inch bump on its face and I couldnt see any ears at that time...The thumb on its had were more chimp like.Higher on the hand and longer.I think it had 5 fingers and there had no hair on the palms.the hairs were more tapered like claws not human fingernails.It only looked across the valley where I was one time and its eyes were brown and animal like large pupils.It hair up to its lower eyes and a wide mouth.Not much in the way or a chin and its forehead was lined deeply.I was using Nikon zoom binoculars that had 7-15x40 power and was able to see a lot of details.I kept wishing for a camera...After viewing it for Id say 15 mins I heard a vocalization very soft from higher on the hill.I never saw what made it and since I only barely caught it couldnt say how it sounded.But the bigfoot looked that way and stood up and made a return sound that almost sounded like too pieces of hard steel rod banged together.Kind of a ping sound and it walked that way.It had no tail and was very broad across the shoulders.I believe these are a unique species and are pure animal.Not in anyway related to humans.However I think their senses like smell and hearing,eyesight are very acute and they have a lot of intelligence thats why people never see them hardly.They dont want to be seen and avoid encounter with man.Never saw one before and never since.But I dont go into the woods before daylight anymore.I wait till I can see.And if mushroom hunting or looking for indian relics I carry a heavy caliber pistol.I wouldnt want the tangle with one of them period.I never told anybody about my sighting.I figured they would think I was nuts.","classification":"Class A","county":"Douglas","state":"Missouri","latitude":36.8109,"longitude":-92.3046,"latlng":"-92.3046,36.8109","locationDetails":"second road to the right on AC highway.On the far side of a dry creek above the road to the north about 300 yards.Theres a old log cabin on the side I was on.","dewPoint":48.85,"humidity":0.9,"cloudCover":0.84,"moonPhase":0.64,"pressure":1006.88,"weatherSummary":"Breezy in the morning and heavy rain in the morning and overnight.","uvIndex":2,"visibility":5.72,"highTemp":60.23,"midTemp":49.89,"lowTemp":39.55,"precipitationIntensity":0.0454,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":145,"windSpeed":8.63}
{"id":"36761","timestamp":59184000,"title":"Memory told of a close encounter while deer hunting east of Salem","observed":"Hi, my name is Kevin, I'm 52 now. I went hunting with my dad in Dent County near what now is called Lake 117 east of Salem Missouri in Mark Twin National forest. I was approx. 1/4 mile from the old farmhouse up a tree with a view from 10 ft. off the ground approx. Anyhow I remember seeing a doe running by my stand looking scared and then I saw why. It was a tall black man running after it except that was not a black man chasing a deer naked, one went to my left and I could hear loud thrashing in the thick section of woods and I assumed it had caught the animal and was killing it. Astounded I could not believe what I had just seen and then it was when I turned to my right there he stood 20 ft from my tree and was standing there looking at me and I remember thinking who are these black men running naked thru the woods? but wait this was a very hairy being with a type of crest on its somewhat of an oddly shaped head, black hair but thinner in spots and when we made eye contact it growled very deeply. I was so frickin scared I could not understand what was going on, I have goose bumps and fear still to this day 40 years later. I don't like being ridiculed I have tears in my eyes now trying to write this to people that might understand this situation. Scardest I've ever been and in my life time I have had two guns pulled on me, sorry I'm wandering from my encounter. This being of the woods had black eyes and a light tan colored nose that was somewhat triangular looking to me, so this giant tall very strong looking being turned and started running over towards the thrashing sound but I couldn't believe how lucky I felt. Just a step or two and it could of yanked me right out of the tree I was in and soon as it was out of sight I believe I just jumped out of the tree I was in and started running up the logging road back to the farm house where my dad was. I remember stopping and turning around with my dads thirty thirty and I shot in the direction of it and yelling to leave me alone and on the rest of the way back to the farmhouse approx. 300 yds it was paralleling me in the thick woods making all kinds of rackit. I still get scared thinking of this I felt I was lucky that it didn't kill me i was around 11 or 12 and when I finally got back to the farm house my dad was there having a nip, if ya know what I'm saying, he could tell something was wrong with me, and i did my best to explain to him what was going on outside so he headed out. But the beast must have headed back to the deer kill 300 yds away. Umm I'm not sure if he ever truly believed me and that really upset me and I took his whiskey away from him and said now listen dad you have to believe me what I just saw. Well the owner of the farm arrived the next day and he believed me. I was so relieved he truly believed me and i could tell. He was a local doctor and told me he had seen giant footprints in the sand on his beach of his lake what now is this conservation lake he must have left them after he passed away. But I remember him being so interested in what had happened to me and truly believing me. Dang this brings fear and tears too me still the trying too understand, what the heck was going on around me in this deer stand. Never been that scared again, it was so hard to see this and understand that it was real so I've heard that it was one in a million chance of this happening. All I can say is how lucky i was that I wasn't on the menu that day so after analyzing this I truly believe that even though they are giant, inside they won't hurt you but will harass you to leave them alone and remember never look them in the eyes he will let out a very very deep growl and your legs will start shaking uncontrollably. I believe they just want to be left alone, still curious on how humans live. Think about it they could take you with out a problem, you have no chance at all, when I think back about this that is what I have interpreted I guess I would be famous if I had shot it but i didn't have that in me and still don't think i do. I appreciate what you BFRO guys and gals have done except if you would just stay longer in a area that one or more have been sighted that's how you will get your chance at some greater evidence. I wish I had never repressed this memory. Bothers me. Also I see in 2005 a guy had heard one only a couple of miles from where I had my encounter. I believe these animals are in small groups and travel nomadically thru out the thick woods and I guess they eat a lot of deer. I know they had caught one not too far maybe 30 are 40 yds from my stand in this thick woods. I could hear them but couldn't see what was going on. Listen just give me a call and I will tell ya what happened that day. I am ready to discuss this with you pros, dang you guys are so bold. P.S. If you stick with this you will eventually get your film but you have to be ready constantly because they run fast really fast and I also don't believe this animal knows what a trail camera is. Come on just hang in there and be ready and if they are close don't look them in the eyes, he growls unbelievable. Thank you and i would like too try and accompany you guys sometime.

{"id":"496","timestamp":240451200,"title":"Campers see large figure cross river in moonlight","observed":"The sighting occurred sometime afer dark.  I was in my sleeping bag sleeping on a sandbar with three other guys on the Meramec River after an afternoon of canoeing and fishing.  I was awaken and was looking upstream into a beautiful bright, full moon.  The light being given off was so bright, that you could read by moonlight alone.  Suddenly about 20 yards upstream to my left, a very large, very massive creature walking on two legs, stepped into the river to cross.  It appeared to have a very massive upper body.  Because of the moonlight and angle I could see that its body had a very \"furry\" appearance to it. When it walked, I could see its arms sway and its knees bend with every step.  I also noted a very pronounced crest on the top of its head and a very pronounced ridge on its eyebrow line.  I was on my back looking upstream and propped myself up on my elbows for a better look.  As I did this, Greg who was off to my left propped himself up also and said out loud, \"What the hell is it?\".  I answered, not taking my eyes off the creature, \"I don't know, must be somebody ripping off cabins.\" Implying a human form.  Immediately upon Gregs words, the creature turned at the waist and looked at us only taking its eyes off us to look at the other bank when it exited the river.  When it looked at us, its face blacked out due to turning away from the moonlight.  I remember hearing the creature cutting the water, which was about 3 feet deep, as it walked.  The water flow was very fast and no man could have crossed this area and remained standing for very long.  The water came up to the creatures knees.  I could see its knees bend as it lifted them to walk. It exited the river on the right side and we lost sight of it.  This sighting lasted only about 10 seconds, but lives vividly in my memory.  The next morning when Greg and I recalled what we had seen to the other guys, we were severely ridiculed.  Because of this, we didn't go and check for tracks or other sign.  We both agreed that what we saw was not human and far too tall and massive to be a person or bear.  We both then agreed that it had to be a Bigfoot we had seen. I do recall that the draw that the Bigfoot had come out of prior to entering the water was very dark, with thick brush and a spring fed creek in it.  As we were floating by,  I remember having a very uneasy feeling about it as I was looking at it and would not have gone into it.","classification":"Class A","county":"Crawford","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.8597,"longitude":-91.432,"latlng":"-91.432,37.8597","locationDetails":"We had put in our canoes at the Highway 19 bridge, floated north about 4 or 5 hours before camping before nightfall.","dewPoint":71.07,"humidity":0.77,"cloudCover":0.36,"moonPhase":0.02,"pressure":1017.18,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy until evening and humid throughout the day.","uvIndex":7,"visibility":6.52,"highTemp":89.23,"midTemp":81.94,"lowTemp":74.65,"windBearing":143,"windSpeed":6.39}

My folks were getting ready for bed, and that is what woke me up. We lived on a farm in rural Missouri, not far from the town of Prairie Home. We had a kitchen door that had a window in it that faced out to our carport. Beyond the carport was a two-acre field with trees at the far end. I got a glass of water---my back to the door---when I felt a presence. Well our nearest neighbor was over a 1/4 mile away, and I thought that maybe our cattle had strayed from our bigger parcel into the small 2-acre field. I moved my stool over to the door and got up on it. I cupped one of my hands to cut the glare from the kitchen light on the window. It was pitch black out. I turned on the carport light, and put my face back up to the window---it was still dark for a second or two when something stepped back from the door to allow the carport light to illuminate the situation. The thing that stepped back from the window was very tall---much taller than the standard height of a door---it had been so close to the door that it was blocking all the light from the carport. I screamed, and dropped the water that I had in one hand. The thing outside my door looked right, then left, stepped back a couple of steps---then turned and ran across the carport---and through the field into the woods that bordered it. It was a couple hundred feet from the carport to the tree line, and I saw exactly where it entered the trees. It did not take long for it to reach the trees. Before it ran---it was definitely looking right at me. It had very dark brown, and/or black hair. I could see the reflection of the light from the kitchen in its eyes. I do not remember seeing any white in the eyes. The face had some areas that showed dark skin, with tufts of hair sticking out or surrounding the face and head. I never saw any teeth. Its arms were much longer in proportion to humans. They seemed to hang to the knees. There was long hair at the wrists that seemed to hang down over the hands. When I saw a grizzly bear run later on in life---I thought that the way its hair “flopped” up and down was the way it did on the Mo Mo that I saw.","classification":"Class A","county":"Cooper","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.81124,"longitude":-92.59781,"latlng":"-92.59781,38.81124","locationDetails":"west of Prairie Home on Highway J.

I was nearing the rounding of a sharp curve in the road which features a gully that empties into a creek, that then empties into an outer portion of the Little Platte River. The area is a mixture of farmland, which is primarily corn or soybean ground, some cow pastures and a mixture of  trees, gully's, and waterways which flow into the river. As I entered the curve my eyes caught a a large shadow as it crossed the road 50 yards in front of me. My initial reaction to this was oh a deer, there are probably more so I hit the brakes a slowed slightly. In the time it took me to blink my eyes and reopen them the shadow had passed completely across the roadway and was at the edge of the ditch, as the distance between us closed and more of the light from the headlights illuminated the shadow. I was able to get a better view of what I was dealing with. What I had thought was a deer was in fact much larger, and upright. As the light caught the side of the creature it made an extremely agile motion which consisted of two steps from the edge of the ditch to the fence line. In the same motion the creature placed its left hand on the top wire of the fence, jumped and cleared the fence with both feet and disappeared into the corn. Description: Height: 7' to 7 1/2' it was very tall Width: Unknown, my view was a complete side profile view Depth: 24\"-30\" easy maybe more Hair: shaggy light red/brown. The hair length on the body, at least the portions I was able to see varied, some portions were longer others shorter. Reminds me of how the hair is on my Golden Retriever in a way. The creature was very stout and the weight had to have been 350-400 lbs. possibly more. I did not get a view of the creature's head or face at all, the face was a complete shadow the entire time and even with the light from the headlights there was no eye glow. The feet and legs were all but blocked from view as well either from the lack of light or from the vegetation once it was in the ditch. The portion I got the best view of was the left arm as it braced the top wire of the fence and made its jump over.  The arm was very large and hair covered, the hair appeared to be longer above the elbow than it was below, with the hair on the hand being the shortest.","classification":"Class A","county":"Clinton","state":"Missouri","latitude":39.60238,"longitude":-94.40015,"latlng":"-94.40015,39.60238","locationDetails":"I could provide the approximate location again but there are no real distinguishing landmarks which make this area of the roadway stand out from the rest of the surroundings.","dewPoint":68.65,"humidity":0.74,"cloudCover":0.13,"moonPhase":0.47,"pressure":1016.17,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy in the morning and humid throughout the day.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":9.94,"highTemp":87.91,"midTemp":81.4,"lowTemp":74.89,"precipitationIntensity":0.0005,"precipitationProbability":0.16,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":174,"windSpeed":8.17}

{"id":"6775","timestamp":1102204800,"title":"Child has daylight sighting along Meramec River","observed":"This happened about 1982, in the area of Steelville Missouri. We were camping on the Meremac River. The group consisted of myself, my wife, my son, my daughter and a friend and his wife. The place we camped was on an elderly ladies farm. There were about 5 other campsites, all about 30 yards apart, with our campsite being on the end and closest to where the woods became thick. There was a dirt road that went from our spot into the woods a short distance. While myself and my friend were gathering fire wood, my son...about 7 at the time, sat at the begining of the road playing in the dirt. My wife said all of a sudden he looked down the road, jumped up and made a bee line for her, all the time yelling \" Mommy a big black man. My friend and I heard him screaming and ran back to camp to see what was wrong. I know my son was young at the time, but I'd never seen him so upset. He kept repeating that he saw a big black man standing part way down the road. Now at the time, we lived in St. Louis and my son was used to seeing black people but he insisted this man was differant. After we calmed him down he told us the man was real tall. Way taller than me or my friend, who was about 6'2'. He also insisted the man wasn't wearing clothes but was covered with black hair. My friend and I were both armed and decided to take a look down the road. It was getting dark by then and we didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary except it did smell like something dead was close. There was to be a huge meteore shower that night so we walked out into a pasture to have a clear view of the sky. The pasture bordered the woods on our left, with our camp and the river to our front. We hadn't been sitting there long when we heard something heavy walking around in the woods. At first we thought it might be a stray cow but the more we listened it sounded more like the way a man would move. What really got our attention was that all of a sudden we heard limbs snapping. Not small ones but big enough to sound like rifle shots. I'm a Vietnam Vet and a long time hunter. I've never heard anything move through woods like that. It spooked us enough that even though we were armed, both carrying .44 cal hand guns, we didn't venture into the woods to investigate. That ended our star gazeing and we spent most of the rest of the night sitting in camp with our pistols close at hand. The next day we found where something had bulldozed it's way through the heavy bush and left some good sized broken limbs and saplings in its wake, but to be honest we didn't look too close. Also the smell of something dead was gone. The rest of the camping trip was un eventfull though I did notice one thing. The lady who's land we were camping on was carrying a 12 gage shotgun every time we saw her. She even had it across her lap when she'd sit on her porch. Never knew her to do that before. She was of old hillbilly stock and not one to scare easy so I asked her about it. She just replied she wanted it close and would say no more. To sum it up, My son's insisting he saw a very big hairy black man, the way it frightened him,the noise that night and the broken trail of brush and limbs, the smell and the elderly ladies keeping her shotgun  close at hand, I have to wonder.

It was around 11, 11 20 PM on a Thursday night and the park is remote and empty on a night like that. I am 29 and stand 6 foot 6 inches. My vision is 15/20 in my left eye, better than normal. As I came around the curb, I had the National Preserve, Meramec State Park to my right. As I looked ahead some 70 to 100 feet and I saw this tall monkey with long legs go by under one of the lights. I immediately looked to my right at the three line as fear overwhelmed my body. I turned around, pacing myself back towards town, trying to make sense of what I saw. It stood about 7 feet, and it was hairy, the hair of the arms was hanging 3, to 4 inches, it was the only part of the silhouette that was clearly hairy and I could notice clearly that it had ape like hairy arms. I went back to the house and researched the subject on you tube, but most of the videos showed a much heavier set creature. A lot of people that I talked to just can not believe me. Last night I came across the Jacobs video and the similarity struck me. I know that is hard to believe what I saw and I myself was a skeptic of this phenomenon, until it happened to me.

We stopped at a small conservation area known as Riverside off a dirt road that shares the same name. There is a boat ramp off the Meremac River and a picnic table about 50 yards off the road and obstructed by woods and brush. There are trash barrels at the location and fishermen empty their coolers and discard fishing waste when they take their boats out of the water. There are farms and residences in the area, but nothing for about half a mile due to the area's proclivity to flood. There have also been incidents of violence in this location in the past (person on person) so there's a local aversion to the area, which makes it particularly absent of people at night. The three of us were talking and walking down the boat ramp to the edge of the river (the trees and brush make the ramp the only place that the river is visible in this area). There is a small gravel bar/island that is heavily wooded about 200 feet from the edge of the boat ramp where the river forks and splits. There was a decent amount of moon light and we were watching the water. We heard some noise in the brush on the island or maybe the opposite bank. A few moments passed and what sounded likes a rock hit the bank on our side (maybe fifteen or twenty feet down river) followed by what sounded like another rock landing in the river (presumably in the same vicinity of the first rock). We froze for maybe ten seconds, then we heard what we all collectively determined to sound like an ape yowling from about the same direction of the noises and rocks. I would say the sound was more like a one tone, moderately deep exhale or grunt that had a shrill undertone that gave it an aggressive feeling. We left immediately. We've all lived in rural areas for most of our lives and know the sounds of local wildlife. This sound wasn't one any of us had encountered before.

{"id":"11453","timestamp":1113523200,"title":"Vocalizations and wood knocking in Mark Twain National Forest.","observed":"I don't know what to think.  I have visited this website many, many times and was impressed by what I have read and the research you do.  I have to add what I have experienced. First a little background on me: I am 60 years old and work for the U.S. Government.  I have been camping for most of my life and was an Adult Boy Scout Leader and Trainer for approx. 20 years.  I have been hunting for over 30 years as well.  I know the animals that inhabit the woods in Missouri. I own 80 fenced acres of private property in the Mark Twain National Forest in Dent County Missouri.  I am bordered on the southeast 40 acres by a farm and on the northwest 40 acres by a farm.  The rest is all National Forest on all sides of my property.  On my property there is a wet weather creek that almost always has a little water in it.  My property is mostly oak forest with about 10 acres of open space that was once used for grazing cattle.  There is a pine foreset on the northeast side where an old logging road is our entrance to the property. I have heard some strange vocalizations since buying the property over 3 years ago.  I have heard the same or similar sounds or \"vocalizations\" on this website.  I know what bobcat, coyote, screech owls, barred owls and most other \"forest animals and birds\" sound like and these vocalizations don't sound like any of these.  I have also heard the banging of wood on trees in the woods around me at night. I was staying overnight at this \"farm/hunting cabin\" of mine on the weekend of 15-17 April 2005.  There was a 3/4 moon out and the nights were very clear and somewhat cool (about 48-52 degrees on Friday & Saturday nights) but I had the window cracked as I like to go to sleep to the \"night sounds\".  I had just gone to bed (about 10:30PM) on Friday night when I heard the \"night sounds\" completely stop.  About 4-5 minutes later I heard an incredibly loud screech or scream come from somewhere close and from the southwest of my \"farm/hunting cabin\" (probably within 200-300 yards at the most).  About 30 seconds later there was an answering vocalization from quite a ways off and to the southeast.  This repeated 4 different times.  Each time the vocalizations got closer together and the one closest to my cabin got farther away towards the southeast.  Between the 2nd and 3rd vocalizations I heard a banging like a board was being smacked against a tree.  There was 3 load bangs from close to me and then three (almost answering) bangs from the vocalization farther away.  After the 4th vocalization (which seemed very close to each other and farther from me) all the vocalizations and tree banging stopped.  About 3-4 minutes later the whippoorwills started in and the \"night sounds\" came back to the woods. On Saturday night it was very much like the night before except there were no vocalizations or tree banging, just the \"night sounds\" ceasing and about 3-4 minutes later the window right next to my bed (on the outside this window is about 4 feet from the ground to the bottom of the window and the window is 2' wide and 3' tall) went completely dark as if something stood outside and blocked out the moon and stars at the window.  This \"blackout\" only lasted for 2-5 seconds. I don't know exactly how long for sure as I was practically holding my breath and trying to be as quiet as possible.  I even reached for my pistol just to be safe.  I had the window slightly open and DID NOT smell anything special like I have read about.  I did smell what smelled like a wet dog and there were no dogs around that weekend.  I should know as I have 2 Labrador Retrievers and a Rottweiler, none of which where with me at the time.  I did go to the door, after the moonlight came back in through the window, and turned on the porch light to see if I could see what had blocked out the moonlight.  There was nothing there and there was not even a cloud in the night sky.  I was alone at the \"farm/hunting cabin\" doing some scouting for the upcoming Turkey season.  The next morning I looked under the window and as much as 10 feet away for any sign of footprints but there was nothing there.

{"id":"40087","timestamp":406166400,"title":"Man recalls encounters while camping with his hunting party south of Cabool","observed":"It was a Tuesday evening at approximately 6:30 p.m. There were three of us in our deer camp, and three others had gone into town for camping supplies. It was the second week in November, and I was deer hunting with my family (Mom, Dad, & little Brother), and two close family friends in the Mark Twain National Forest approximately 7 miles south of Cabool, Mo. in Douglas County, Mo. My Mom, Dad, & little Brother had gone into town for supplies just after sundown, and left myself, and the two friends (Shawn & Dennis) at the camp site. Shortly after dark, we were all three sitting around the campfire, and heard what we thought was a deer rubbing its antlers. We got up and snuck back behind the tents in the direction of the sound.  We did not have any light source with us except for the camp fire light behind us. The conditions were partly cloudy, and moonlit. Visibility was really good. As we approached the area, what we immediately recognized to be a Bigfoot stepped out from behind a tree. My friend Shawn was 6'8\" and he had to physically lift his head to look at the creature's face. We instantly turned and ran back to our camp where our deer rifles were.The people in the camp next to us fired one shot into the darkness, and was yelling to get their things packed as we ran to the our camp site.  We grabbed our guns, reloaded them, and began piling more wood on our fire. We had three lanterns in camp, so I was elected to take them out into the woods just outside of our campsite on all sides to allow for better vision. We then all sat with our backs to the fire, and our guns in our laps. We began to hear heavy footsteps in multiple directions, and then we started seeing either four of five of these things circling our camp. There was one that was positioned just on the other side of the dirt road that was pacing back and forth, and stopping to squat down and stare for a moment. After approximately 45 minutes of being circled and watched, but never approached in any way, my parents returned. They were immediately concerned about the ENORMOUS size of our fire. We quickly explained what was happening, and my dad decided we should go stay in town for the night. While we were extinguishing the fire, the campers next to us made a hasty exit out of the woods. We grabbed a change of clothes and went to a motel for the night. The next morning, when we returned to camp, nothing had been touched at all. Everything was just as we had left it, including a deer hanging in a tree which Shawn had harvested the day before. My Dad gave us the option of going home, or staying to continue hunting. We chose to stay under the conditions that everybody hunted close to camp for a while. I decided to hunt back behind our camp, where the first sighting occurred the night before. I sat down on a sharp ridge overlooking a very deep, very steep valley. I hadn't been sitting there more than 10 minutes, when I saw a bigfoot ascending the steep slope on the other side of the valley. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I raised my rifle to view it through my scope, and as I watched it negotiate very treacherous terrain with ease, it turned and looked directly at me, grabbed a live tree approximately 5\" in diameter, and broke it in half with one hand. It then turned and disappeared over the top of the far ridge. I hurried back to camp to tell the others, and we went to the spot where I had seen it, and next to the broken tree was a print that appeared almost human-like. Shawn placed his size 16 hunting boot inside the track, and there was a margin of space around his boot of approximately an inch to an inch and a half.","classification":"Class A","county":"Douglas","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.02496,"longitude":-92.11988,"latlng":"-92.11988,37.02496","locationDetails":"Due south  apprx. 15 to 20 miles of Cabool on Hwy.181 just past the county line of Texas and Douglas Co.","dewPoint":18.46,"humidity":0.58,"cloudCover":0.16,"moonPhase":0.01,"pressure":1029.68,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.","uvIndex":3,"visibility":9.03,"highTemp":45.31,"midTemp":35.395,"lowTemp":25.48,"windBearing":160,"windSpeed":5.31}
{"id":"18442","timestamp":524361600,"title":"Memory told of being chased on a farm near Ava","observed":"I was staying all night at my friend's house located off of KK Highway in Douglas County, Missouri.  This particular friend just lived a couple of miles from my home. She had told me about how she had heard loud, \"puppy-like\" howling noises, and how she always felt like she was being followed when she went on walks in the woods that surround her home.  She smoked, and said that when she was out on these walks she would at times hear something walking behind her, but when she lit her cigarette, the sounds seemed to stop.  Well, being fifteen and stupid at the time, I came up with this idea to go find what ever it was.  I thought that whatever it was had to be scared of fire, due to her whole cigarette analysis.  So, we took some hay from their barn and put it in paper bags.  We put the bags on the ends of thick branches that we found to make these so-called \"torches\".  I secured the bag to the branch on one of these torches with my belt.  So the adventure began.  We headed across their field toward the woods.  It was dusk at the time.  The field was about the one and a half lengths of a football field (I am not into sports, so I cannot really tell you actual feet).  When we reached the edge of the woods, which is where the family dumped some trash, we looked at each other and decided this was not such a bright idea.  We turned around and headed back to the house.  When we were around midway through the field something big and grey came darting toward us from the edge of the woods.  The distance between us and it was probably around 200 feet.  I took off running, without even telling my friend what I was running from; thankfully she followed.  I didn't even realize I still had those torches in my hands, which I finally dropped when we reached the area of the barn, which was about 100 feet from the house.  We ran into the house and stayed there for about 15 minutes, while I tried to fill her in about what I saw.  After we got enough courage up, we went outside again.  We could see about midway into the field a large, grey-colored, ape-like creature squatting down in the brush of the field.  It was just squatting there looking at us.  That was enough, and back into the house we went.  That night, we heard all kinds of commotion outside.  The next morning I had realized my belt was still out there by the barn.  when we went to get it, we found the torches ripped to shreds.  My belt had been torn into pieces, with teeth marks all over the leather clasp.  There were dents knocked into an old car the family had parked in the field.  Later, my friend told me that a little red wagon that was dumped in the dump site was bent in half.  Every time I stayed all night with this friend, whatever it was acted up with this type of behavior.  My friend actually had a calf that died with its neck broken and twisted all the way around after I had stayed the night.  I told my parents about this, and my dad actually wanted to go hunt whatever it was.  I haven't told a lot of people about this, because of fear that no one would believe me.  I go camping sometimes, and I am still very alert to my surroundings to this day, because I never want to see another one for the rest of my life.","classification":"Class A","county":"Douglas","state":"Missouri","latitude":36.94109,"longitude":-92.7622,"latlng":"-92.7622,36.94109","locationDetails":"Western Douglas County, just west off KK Highway.","dewPoint":63.97,"humidity":0.66,"cloudCover":0.67,"moonPhase":0.31,"pressure":1013.53,"weatherSummary":"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.","uvIndex":7,"visibility":8.76,"highTemp":87.05,"midTemp":79.205,"lowTemp":71.36,"windBearing":184,"windSpeed":6.34}
{"id":"5123","timestamp":1100822400,"title":"Loud calls, rock/boulder throwing disturbs campers","observed":"Overview: Dates - Oct. 17 -20, 2002 Location - Douglas County, MO near Dora, MO - Mark Twain National Forest Campground off CC Highway, North Fork, Campsite #20 (Pine loop). Evidence - Loud calls, rock/boulder throwing, footprints, displaced log in middle of lower trail, multiple incidents. Witnesses - Myself and camping partner, Carl. No other campers were in the entire park on 10/17/02. Incident #1 10/17/02 approx 7:30-8:00 PM After eating dinner my camping partner and I were sitting in front of the large camp fire facing the stream (North Fork of the White river). It was an extremely quiet night. No crickets, or locusts or frogs/toads could be heard at all. It was very quite. We were talking and listening to music. Over the music I heard an animalistic sounding call out of my right ear. I heard it twice before I asked Carl if he heard it. To me it sounded about 150 - 200 yards away, upstream and on the opposite side of the stream up on the bluffs over looking the stream. He said, \"I hear something\". I jumped up and turned off the music. Immediately after turning off the music we both heard a similar call from downstream approximately 50-100 yards away. It sounded as though it was coming from the upper path running parallel to the stream. The campsite (#20 - Pine Loop) was unique as it was created in the middle of the upper trail. In other words, someone walking the trail would actually walk right in the middle of the campsite. The call was very unusual. It sounded initially somewhat canine. When I first heard the second call I was unsure of my original impression of the first call coming from upstream. Carl and I are both avid outdoor/camping enthusiasts. Carl 50-60 years old and has been an outdoorsman most of his life. I am 30-40 years old and have been camping many times as a child, with Carl twice per year for the last 10 years, and with my own family. We have both heard many identifiable animal calls while in the forest. This was an animal call that was unlike anything we had ever heard, or seen on any documentary or while camping. To describe the sound this animal made is difficult. It began the call as a canine type \"howl\" followed by a \"whoop\" or \"bark\" repeated several times. This was NOT a coyote or wolf. The pitch was much deeper and tonal quality gave the impression of something larger than a coyote or wolf. The animal made 2-3 of these \"howl/whoops\" and then was silent. During the silence Carl and I speculated as to the source. We immediately ruled out coyote and wolf as we had both heard those animals in the past. We heard no movement of the animal during the silence - but we were talking/whispering to each other and could have missed any movement sounds. 30-45 seconds after the downstream calls, what we believed to be the same animal let out a call the truly defies description. The animal was now almost directly in front of us if not slightly downstream. The sound appeared to come from the lower path running parallel to the stream just in front of us. This would make the animal approx 35 yards away between the campsite and the stream. The call was another \"howl/whoop\" combination repeated 2-3 times. It was so loud that the echo from behind me was almost equal to the original sound in volume. It was a \"blood curdling\" call. Clearly the animal was either posturing or warning us. I felt the call was directed specifically to us. The call was almost human - but would have had to be a very large tall human. The depth and volume of the call indicated to me an animal of a minimum of 150 - 200 pounds. For the first time in my 38 years, an animal call triggered my \"fight or flight response\". I immediately picked up a large knife and felt an almost over-whelming urge to loudly scream back into the darkness and to rush toward the sound. My adrenaline was pumping. I said to Carl that I felt the sound resembled a large human imitating a wolf. That the call was very \"exaggerated\" and was clearly meant to scare us. We speculated that someone might be playing a hoax on us. Carl responded that he felt this was a close description of the sound. Just as he said those words, not more than 5 seconds after the end of the loud call in front of us, we heard a second animal make the SAME call from 150 yeards or so UPSTREAM. When we heard the second animal make an identical call, we knew we were not dealing with a human prank. I am a musician. The second animal was not a human being. The second animal's tonal characteristics and depth matched the first animals almost identically. We humans have such different voices. I would have been able to differentiate the two human voices from each other if it was a prank. When we heard the second animal we knew we were hearing something neither of us could explain. It was NOT human, it was NOT a coyote or wolf, it could not be explained. The second animal seemed to be giving it's location to the first. The first animal seemed \"male\" or parental. The second animal seemed \"female\". Within 30 seconds, The first animal seemed to have moved from in front of us and was now approx 75 -100 yards upstream and on the opposite bank where it met up with the second animal. Both animals then gave 2-3 howling/whoops. Immediately following both animals began a series of completely different sounds. These were very spooky sounding. The sounds were very fast, gutteral and rising and falling in pitch. It sounded like a language to me. It sounded as though they were having a very emotional verbal argument. It was almost like a cross between a gorilla's grunt and a witch's cackle. Then it sounded as if both animals ran further up stream and over the bluff. The enitre series of calls lasted approximately 5-7 minutes. Incident #2 10/17/02 approx 9:45 -10:00 PM. I had gone into the tent to sleep at approx 9:30. Carl followed a little later - approx 10-15 minutes. Immediately after Carl entered the tent we heard one animal make the same \"howl/whoop\" combination 2-3 times and then silence. It appeared to come from the upstream direction about 100-150 yards away. Incident #3 10/18/02 appox 02:00 AM I was awakened by a very loud crashing sound. I heard the sound 2-3 times before I woke Carl up. The sound appeared to some from slightly upstream - maybe 20 yeards or less. The sound was VERY loud. It sounded as if very LARGE (minimum of 20 pound - possibly 100 pound or greater) boulders were being purposely thrown in the stream. The boulders were so large that the sound had to parts. The first was the object hitting the water, the second was the object hitting the river bed itself. It was a \"Splat-boom Boom\" cannon type sound. Carl had been snoring loudly (as do I) prior to waking up. This sound happened at least 12 times over a 5 minute period. I stated to Carl - \"This shows intelligence and strength\". I believe it was still trying to scare us off. Immediately after the last boulder impact we heard one of two animals make a very brief \"howl/whoop\" (1-2 times). It was as if the animal wanted to place his signature on the boulder throwing. Incident #4 10/18/02 While exploring the lower path 20 yards from our campsite, Carl discovered a large log blocking the path. This water soaked log was completely out of place. It did not come from any surrounding trees. When I attempted to pick it up it crumbled in my grasp. We did not see the log on the path on 10/17/02 - however it was dark and we could have missed it. It appeared to also be a \"message\" - as though something wanted to block our path downstream. Incident #5 10/19/02 10:00 AM While walking on the upper path downstream approx 40-75 yards from our campsite, Carl and I found 2 foot prints. They were approx 14 inches in length. The heel and ball of the print appeared very human like - very similar to \"Big Foot\" prints and casts I have seen in various medias. However, the toes were very different. The clearest print showed this to be a THREE-TOED Creature. I am NOT CRAZY. I could not believe only three toes. The toes were very human if not \"pod-like\" in appearance. We took several pictures of the clearest print. We did not have the materials to make a cast. Carl felt the print might not even lend itself to casting. We did get several pictures of the prints. We could not identify any other charateristics from the prints. I will say this - as with the loudest call from directly in front of us - I believe whatever made these prints is very large. A minimum of 6.5 feet tall and 250 pounds. More likely my \"instincts\" tell me it is 7-8 foot tall and 350-500 pounds. It appeared from the angle of the prints that the animal came down the trail and was alarmed/suprised/angry to see our camp blocking the middle of the trail. The trail was hard packed and yielded no prints. The prints found were just off the side of the trail and in very soft and somewhat wet soil.  Incident #6 Unlike the evening of 10/17/02. The evening of 10/18 and 10/19 brought scattered rain showers. Depsite the rain, the forest was NOT eerily quiet as it was on 10/17. Crickets, frogs, etc. were very loud on 10/18 and 10/19.

{"id":"24879","timestamp":1124928000,"title":"Daylight sighting of a white-haired Bigfoot in a yard outside Lonedell","observed":"My four year old son and I were visiting my parents who lived in Lonedell, Missouri. My mother was napping, my father was at work (he helped farm there on the land--they lived in a trailer on the about 350 acres owned by their landlord). I was sitting on the front porch with my son and my parent's dog, Buddy. It was mid-afternoon, probably between 1 and 3 pm. I noticed something or someone walking in the field connected to the front yard coming in our direction. My first instinct was to get my baby and get inside. However, I could not help but stand in the doorway, screen door closed but the wooden door open just enough for me to peer through. Whatever that thing was, it kept coming closer to the trailer. By this time, Buddy (the dog) was timidly barking. I could tell from his bark that he was threatened but afraid. I felt bad leaving the dog out on the porch alone, but was too afraid to go out there. The thing (for lack of a known word to call what it was that I saw)was walking, on two legs, aimlessly, not in a hurry and I could not find a reason as to why it came into the yard as it was just looking around aimlessly and leisurely walking. There was a wooden fence, mostly for decoration and only about 20 feet long, that the thing walked next to. My mother had some decorations (can't remember what) hanging on the fence that the thing seemed to look at. The dog barking did not startle the creature, it just kept walking. I was absolutely astounded by what I was seeing; if not for the fact that the dog was seeing it too, I would have wondered if my eyes and/or brain was playing tricks on me. I decided to be brave and opened the screen door just enough to stick my head outside. That's when the thing looked at me, met my gaze. I just stood there, half afraid of it's reaction and it's next move but more curious than anything. My heart was racing. I held my son up to look at it also, still indoors. After it looked at me and yet showed no fear I had more time to study it and I was racking my brain to identify what it was that I was seeing. Here is the best description I can give...It was between 4-6 feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe in very long white hair. It's face was mostly covered in white hair as well, except for it's eyes and maybe it's mouth. It did not have the snout like a dog, it's shape and build was that of a human's. I even compared it to a bear in my head, but their were not enough similarities. This thing was not very animalistic in behavior--the way it walked and looked at me were more typical of human behaviors. Yet, the way it wandered and seemed oblivious to the man-made things around it (cars, the trailer, even the fence) was more like the characteristics of an animal. I did not get the feeling that it was aggressive or wanting to cause harm. Yet, because of the size and animalistic nature of it, I knew that it was strong and could hurt me, my son, or the dog. It began to walk around the side of the garage, out of my sight, but closer towards the end of the trailer that had the bedroom my mom was napping in. I ran down into the bedroom and began frantically looking out the windows searching to see where it had gone. i woke my mother up in my tizzy and quickly told her what I had seen and I wanted her to look. She was still half-asleep and slow to process what I was saying. I did not see where it went from there. I could not locate it through the windows and I was much too afraid to go outside and look. My mom, my son, and I all sat and talked about what I had seen that afternoon. I was still shook up about it. My son was able to confirm to my mother that it was not a dog, not a bear. The fact that we both saw and heard that dog barking at it helped to convince my mom that it wasn't a human or another dog, bear, etc. My mom said that people down the road have two big white dogs--but like I told her, this thing was walking on two legs, not on all fours like a dog. For many other reasons, I knew it was not a dog. I'd never seen a bear in real life before, but I am sure it was not a bear either. I had heard of and seen animated Yetis on a pc game before. That was the closest thing I could match to what I had seen. I knew then and know now that many people do not believe Yetis are real--but whatever it was that I saw that day makes me wonder if they are in fact real and if that is what I saw. I believe it was late summer when this happened. Nice weather, sunny day. Like I said, mid-afternoon and it was out in the open. There were clear farmlands all around us. One pond stocked with fish and swans right next to the end of the trailer that it went in the direction of. There were also two other ponds on the land. I know that a lot of the 350 acres was wooded. Also, there was a road about 300 feet from where the thing was and also from where I was. There was only about 150 feet between myself and the creature. I'm not good at mathematical estimations, but I was as close as I would have wanted to be to whatever that was. It looked as if it could have made about 10 strides to me in a very short amount of time, so I stayed inside. I've read a few of the other sightings here on your sight, but all that I have read are of people seeing creatures covered in dark brown or almost black long hair. That wasn't the case with me. The description of the hair being that it was very long and covered the whole creature, not tangled, matted, or dissarrayed, but it was a blinding white color--didn't even look dirty or yellowed. I wish I could remember its hands or feet, but I can't. I can say that it's eyes were bigger than that of a human's and seemed very dark. Other than when we met each other's gaze, it had it's head looking down so I could not see it's eyes or facial features well if at all. It did not make any noises at all. It hardly made any sounds while walking. This happened about 5 years ago and I have not forgotten it--never will forget it. In fact, my son still remembers seeing it as well. I told my dad about it when he got home--he couldn't tell me what it was either, had not seen anything like that before. I've told my husband, my brother, some friends--no one can relate to what I saw or help me to name what it was. I often wish I could go back to that day and be less afraid and more willing to study it, to even sit outside and watch it instead of hiding inside. I doubt I will ever see anything like that again, and yet I don't know if I really want to, lol. I hope this helps with your work in some way. I had no idea that there have been so many sightings of similar creatures in Missouri and in our country as a whole. I'm going to look through some more stories of sightings after I submit this--I'm curious to see if anyone else has reported a white creature before. It feels great to share my story with someone who might be able to tell me what it was that I saw that day--someone who might have seen something like this before themselves.

{"id":"46475","observed":"The Backpack trip Draft 9-8-2014  Background:  Biologist at a major biotech company.  No previous experience with Sasquatch or similar, but have seen a couple shows on television (1 episode of finding BF, and one episode of Survivorman). The Survivorman version was more honest in the “I don’t know what that was” category and peeked my interest; later reminded me of the structure I saw on the ravine trail here.  I have many years camping experience, and some deer and turkey hunting, and grew up summers playing Dan’l Boone in the woods, so I am pretty comfortable in the woods normally.  After this, I really have no interest in chasing BF – but would go there again only if I had a few capable buddies together for security.  On August 31st, I went on a solo backpacking trip on the Wilderness Trail at Meramec State Park in eastern Missouri.  The trail traversed a ~10 mile loop through the ~7,000 acres of protected wilderness with backpack campsites scattered along the exterior circumference of the loop.  I started at the main trailhead at the MSP Cabins parking lot, traveling counterclockwise along the route.  I was on the trail at 4PM sharp, a sunny day with chance of evening thunderstorms, highs in the mid 80s.  Trail goes through a heavily forested area, typical Eastern white oak, hickory, with understory trees and shrubs, poison oak, etc.  – significant areas of the trail were overgrown and thick annual weedy undergrowth, and many creek crossings (soil is moist under the rocks, but almost no areas with clean free-flowing water).  After fifty yards or so there is a trail-use sign-in box; the box was pretty full of hiker slips so I gathered the rangers do not check it often.  Heading clockwise, campsites 1&2 are about ½ mile in, and about 3.5 miles are campsites 3&4.  I ran into two people (day hikers) on their way out near the sign-in box.  Human sign became very thin after ½ a mile, and zero footprints or any human sign after the backpacking camp 2.  I was very much alone after that, and evident with the thick weedy overgrowth (thought path was visible nearly always).  As campsites 1&2 were in a hollow that was muddy & buggy I kept going to campsite 4, which was on high ground with much of the undergrowth removed, and excellent visibility.  No sign of large mammal life save one whitetail deer buck I scared about 1 mile short of campsite 3.  The site looked like it had not been used for a year.  No footprints, disturbed anything, and the piles of logs were pretty covered in fungus.  I decided to go a bit further on the trail looking for fresh water before doubling back to make camp; I was a running a little low on water to enjoy lots of drinks.  After campsite 4, the trail heads steeply down into a ravine following a creek (the creek head is more or less at camp 4).  Going down 150 yards or so down the trail in the ravine, its gets very dark and overgrown, and I got a sudden creepy feeling I was being watched, and I kept halting to listen as I may have been hearing echoes of my own pack squeaking.  Trust your instincts.  Not finding water, and the creepy feeling getting much worse, I turned around heading back up to make do with the water I brought in.  Half way back up I noticed I had earlier walked right by a very strange “structure” formed out of 3-6” thick trees bent and broken about 6-12 feet off the ground.  They were all bent inward towards each other from different directions, still with green leaves, and no other trees around showing wind stress or damage, and this being in a protected ravine, it made no sense.  I’ve never seen it like that before, except maybe where one tree felled another, but not bent and broken midway up the trunk.  Besides, there was no big fell-tree in sight.  I shot a few quick pictures with my iPhone and quickly headed up to camp.  Seems safer there being open and with a homey firepit, and a four-square around it of linearly-laid logs etc.  After dinner, I went to bed about 9.  The sleep setup is a camping hammock between trees maybe 30-35’ from the fire, a bugnet bag surrounding the hammock (dark mesh also affords privacy), and a taught inverted V-shaped tarp over all in case it rains.  I was just getting settled and then endless noises started.  Noises I could not identify for the most part.  Around 9:30PM, it was nearly pitch black with occasional wind gusts very high at the top of trees.  Below me towards the deep woods ravine: and then two loud knocks in quick succession.  I recall how loud, close, and how musical they were, not dull bark on bark, but like a baseball bat against a oak tree, or like the sound wood makes when it is being split by an axe.  But nobody could swing an axe that fast, or just make two swings, much less there was no one within miles.  The knocks were followed by sticks breaking underfoot, and then a loud snort or two like a big deer or horse maybe 20’ from my hammock.  I was frozen to move.  Then someone shook my tarp very quick.  I shone my light and saw nothing (but difficult to get good beam through the bug net).  Maybe ½ hour later the sound of a rock landing and loudly clacking against other rocks in a dry creek 25’ behind me, and something plucked one of the strings on my hammock or tarp (boinnnnng).  Man, something was right there.  Again a quick look to catch something and I could see nothing with my flashlight – but the beam only went about 8 feet at most through the bugnet.  At this point and the rest of the night my heart was pounding, and I was praying for rain to make the things go home. A while later, up on the ridge where the single knock came from, a loud ugly animal scream  - maybe six in a row (like a fox makes, but deeper).  At some point I swear someone was messing with a stick on the fire, the coals moved around like someone threw something at them again and again.  I got an impression this was like kids playing around or something.  At the same time, for at least two hours, the constant sound maybe 30-40 feet away of someone walking around quietly and picking through a rotten log or removing bark from a tree.  Like looking for grubs or ?? There aren’t any woodpeckers a 2 AM – right?  Also, I was surprised that no whiporwhills, chuck-will’s-widow or other birds were making noise.  Come to think of it, no owls either.  Very quiet except for these “things”.  The log chipper was flinging bits and pieces – like small twigs landing on my tarp over and over, but would stop if I shone the flashlight.  The whole thing was like someone messing with me having fun.  I sat motionless. But more of the same went on and on.  I did get the impression someone was more curious and insistent then going to eat me.  By then I had my machete, knife, and flashlight in the hammock with me … but I am a small man. I lost track of what came before what between about 1 and 3, but this went on all night until about 4AM.  Around 2, I heard a fluttering sound about the hammock and tarp (like someone blowing several loose raspberries with their lips bbbbfppppt, and flicking the tarp with their fingers).  This was really annoying.  At some point around 3, I fell asleep exhausted, but awoke to the sound of a dog’s collar tags coming closer jing-jing-JING-JING getting louder and closer – Thank heavens, a dog to chase them away!  But I yelled Hey!, and it stopped instantly. But I found there was no dog, and instead it was my zipper pulls jingling together … someone had been flicking and jingling them only 2 feet from my head.  Later I swear I heard people talking, a woman in a casual conversational tone, like someone hiking to camp (again felt great relief.  But who would be hiking to camp at 2 AM, and it stopped suddenly and nobody was here – plus no lights of course.  I hear her again, and then nothing.  Could not make out any words (at one point I thought maybe someone in the woods was messing with me), but there was no one there and no footprints or otherwise noises that people make.  Whatever these things were, they were fast and deadly quiet when they wanted to be.  Occasionally sticks breaking underfoot, or grunts, but not much.   I’ve heard deer breaking sticks underfoot, and grunting, so it wasn’t hugely different from that – but this is 2-3AM, and kept coming back and they would not do it sniffing around a person’s hammock.  I remember a few other things up on the hill behind me.  At some point lot of loud wood cracking – trees being broken or pushed over.  But I don’t recall hearing the thump of them hitting the ground.  Also, in the great distance over the hill outside the park was some kind of a red-neck rodeo with the sound of jeeps and four-wheelers zooming around, and a few distant trains & whistles.  At one point dogs barking very far away back there, - possibly at the red-neck party but they didn’t bark long just a few times (not a coon hunt), and I recall that really upset whatever it was below me in the woods.  I don’t recall what they did in response, but I made a mental note that they became very agitated at the sound of dogs (possibly just lots of stick breaking).  During a quiet spell, I’d had enough and chanced it to out go pee.  I didn’t see anything, but did find one sock was missing from my boot.  Thinking a raccoon got it, and thinking about hiking back with one sock was memorial (funny and annoying at same time).  But the next morning my sock was back, thrown more or less where it should have been. It is possible I was so tired that I just missed the sock in the night, but I’m not sure.  Again, messing with me.  Later I woke to some scratching on my backpack like someone checking it out (the backpack was right behind my head leaning up against the hammock suspension tree) and then that started plucking at my hammock guy-wire.  With a quick flash of the light it stopped and – nothing.  It was hard to see directly behind me, but no Raccoon either and they always move from people and light.  Either way, in the morning, nothing at all messed with my pack, sweaty clothes still sitting on my pack, or my food bag set 50 feet away – all pristine and untouched.  Very late, maybe 4AM, I hear the scream on the hill again, but this time Much deeper voiced.  Maybe a combination bark and scream.  This one really scared me as it sounded like a huge dangerous daddy.  But nothing happened.  Lastly, I heard the most ghostly howling below me.  Quiet at first, but ghostly, with lots of air and echo, like the way a person would tell a campfire ghost story making a ghost howl, starting high and moving the ghostly echo tone gently lower and lower through all the minor notes.  The long ghostly howl ran twice, then it was over.  I almost laughed as it sounded so fake, and ridiculous after such a long crazy night.  Almost like the Matriarch calling everyone home down the hill now that big daddy was back, and time to go to bed.  In the morning, the rain finally came between 6-8AM, I ran out to cover my clothes and batten-down the tarp and was grateful for the peace under the tarp.  Packing up and leaving between 8-9, I noticed a few other things of note, but cannot tell if they were associated, unrelated, or my tired head. 1. The tarp was last to take down.  Shaking all the rain off, I noticed an extremely dark shape in the open woods back above me and facing me.  Black like nothing else.  Set very low, I thought it might be a huge dark gall on the side of a tree trunk 75 yards away.  I moved around a bit and it did not move or change, so I assumed just a gall that got wet.  In hindsight, there was definitely something about that thing that wasn’t right and got my attention so raptly.  Maybe about the size of a crouching adult person, but fatter and shorter. 2. One of the logs next to the fire had been severely gouged out with bits and pieces pulled out.  But after the torrential downpour in the morning, hard to say when that was done.  But not real long ago as they were colored bits.  I might have a photo of it by accident when I took some last shots of the camp, I can look. 3. On the hill above me, it seemed odd that so many large trees (entire trunks), were laid down in linear piles.  Like piles of 6-10 trees on top of another all on the same direction.  Could have been a logging operation, but there was no logical arrangement of the piles to each other, and no road anyway.  That was another spot that was compelling to check out, but I did not feel comfortable going up there to investigate at all. 4. I looked over the small dry creek bed behind me for heavy deer footprints but I could not find any to explain the huge ruckus all night, and the snorting next to me, and the stone clacking in that area.  But it did rain. 5. About 2/3 mile from the exit on the way out, just before the spur to camps 1 & 2, I heard a crash a large limb falling down and hit the ground just maybe 15 feet off the trail to my left.  Pretty close.  Of course hiking I’m looking mostly towards the ground/trail, not up.  A bit startling, but not totally unexpected if we had a downpour and storm in the morning.  But I heard buzzing nearby, and my feet moved before I knew it (having experienced yellow-jacket nests in the wild before).  50 feet away looking back and I saw that the crashed tree/stick or whatever, had a hornets nest on it and the hornets were making a small black cloud.  Fortunately they hung around the nest area being also confused, I took a picture from a distance and got out of there.  In hindsight, could something have really been trying to send me a message to never come back?  Perhaps I’m over-thinking it.  I was out by 11AM and in a daze for a few days after that… Of all the sounds, the deep cry of big-daddy and the creepy ghost howl bothered me the most.  That or the thing shaking and plucking at my tarp guy lines, jingling my sipper pulls over my head,  and tossing rocks and sticks at me.  I could not explain those at all.   The grunts and first set of screams… could be other animals like foxes, huge deer, a bat fluttering under the tarp… well, maybe, but given all this, it’d have to be grand central station for the zoo.

He was shaking and very upset. He said the woods monster was going to get him. I asumed his older brother had scared him. I confronted his brother and told him to quit scaring his brother. He said he was not even near him and wanted to know why he was crying in such hystericks. When I asked my son again he said it was not his brother...it was the woods monster. I went outside to the back yard, our house sets at the edge of a big woods just up from a river. I smelled something musky, I then had a good idea what he might have seen. My son is 5yrs old, He knows nothing of bigfoot other than the monster truck. When asked again he said it was just looking at him, I asked was he small or...before I could say anymore he said no, he was big like this...pointing to the ceiling in our livingroom. My wife asked, why do you say he...my son replied..he's just like us only bigger. Then I asked him if he smelled anything. He said yes it stunk like a skunk. We laughed at what he said and decided to drop it so he could calm down and sleep that night. The next morning he came to our bed, I asked him if he was going outside today...he said no..then said if he did he would not go near the woods. My wife asked if he could draw what he saw. He said yes. He took a piece of printer paper and got his crayons. He dumped out the crayons and after a second or so said Do you seen the brown crayon. I told him it was still in the crayon tin. He first drew a big rectangle and colored it brown. Then he took the red and drew arms and legs and head. He also drew some squigly line around it, those were the branches he was looking through. Then I got on the computer, I found the picture of the Patterson film. As soon as the picture materialized on the screen my son backed up and said THATS IT. I beleve my son 100% because abot 20-21yrs ago I seen something similar not 200yrds in the same woods. And in 1975 my now brother-in-law saw the same thing not 10 miles or so from here. I just found out today that some people not more than 3 miles from here had some kind of an incident the night after my son seen what he saw. If interested in the other stories you may contact me. I wished that my sons encounter not list any names due to ridicule from people in the area. Myson had to many right answers to what he saw for someone who didn't even know this thing exists. I dont talk about my encounter, and never have around my sons. And we monitor what they watch on tv. He had all the right answers. A 5yr old doesn't just pull things like that out of his imagination.","classification":"Class A","county":"Gasconade","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.28,"longitude":-91.6253,"latlng":"-91.6253,38.28","locationDetails":"Withheld by request.","dewPoint":34.46,"humidity":0.51,"cloudCover":0.02,"moonPhase":0.31,"pressure":1015.7,"weatherSummary":"Clear throughout the day.","uvIndex":8,"visibility":9.72,"highTemp":71.98,"midTemp":57.78,"lowTemp":43.58,"windBearing":323,"windSpeed":1.76}
{"id":"5286","timestamp":1028851200,"title":"Meteor watchers see large two-legged dark creature approach vehicle near Springfield","observed":"The events of that I am about to relate to you happened on August 9, 2002. just outside of Springfield Missouri. It was about 2:00am. My son and I had driven out into the country to get away from the city lights to watch the Persudes meteor Shower. We drove south on Hwy ZZ and stopped at the top of a large hill. We turned west onto a gravel road and stopped on the top of a hill. There were no close by trees or structures to interfere with our viewing of the night sky. It was a clear night with no moon. After a few minutes in the dark our eyes adjusted quite well. We could see the open fields to the East and south and north of us. Looking west we could see the light colored road going down the hill and off into the distance. After watching the sky for a few minutes I noticed out of the corner of my eye something large moving in the field south of us. At first I couldn't tell if I was actually seeing something or not, when I looked directly at it I couldn't see it but then if I looked  off center of it I could see it in my peripheral vision. At times it seemed to be moving west then east. I realized it was zigzagging back and forth. I asked my son if he saw it but he didn't. About then there was a flurry of shooting stars and I diverted attention to the sky again figuring it must have been a cow or a deer. After a few minutes both my son and I were facing north east when we heard a very deep and loud growl from behind us. Almost together we turned to each other and said\" did you hear that\". Turning around we both could see a large object in the road. We could not make out any details except its outline against the light colored roadway. It was huge, it seemed to have a roughly man like shape but a kind of cone head and extremely wide shoulders. It was swaying back and forth about half way down the hill. After watching it for a few seconds I realized that it was swaying back and forth because it was walking up the hill toward us. At this time it growled yet again, a very low deep rumble like growl. I noticed how quiet everything else was. In fact I remember thinking how funny it was that the thing made no sound on the gravel as it walked. By this time it was getting fairly close, perhaps three to four car lengths away. It growled once again very loud and what seemed unnaturally long. With that my son screamed \"lets get the hell out of here\" We jumped into our car and I floored it down the road and back to the highway. I didn't slow down till we hit town. The next day, (in full daylight of course) I went back out to the spot. I didn't find any tracks or anything. I did however notice that there was a 4 foot high barbwire fence between the field on the South and the road. If this thing was the same thing that I had seen in the field zigzagging across it would have had to step or jump the fence, as the fence was not strong enough for anyone to climb. Especially something as big as this. I do not know what it was but it obviously did not want us there and made no bones about it. I am very curious if anyone else in this area has seen anything similar recently.","classification":"Class A","county":"Greene","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.0968,"longitude":-93.4303,"latlng":"-93.4303,37.0968","locationDetails":"South on Hwy ZZ to the Greene / Christian county line, turn west on side road.","dewPoint":56.97,"humidity":0.6,"cloudCover":0.04,"moonPhase":0.03,"pressure":1018.9,"weatherSummary":"Clear throughout the day.","uvIndex":10,"visibility":9.34,"highTemp":87.8,"midTemp":77.51,"lowTemp":67.22,"precipitationIntensity":0.0001,"precipitationProbability":0.13,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":112,"windSpeed":3.88}
{"id":"9502","timestamp":1102204800,"title":"Young horse rider has daytime sighting near Ash Grove.","observed":"I grew up on a dairy farm, and would bring in the cows for the evening milking.  This was often done on horse back for both pleasure and convenience. Since I was only ten years old at the time I didn't have to actually milk the cows after they were at the barn, and could ride the horse while my brother and father milked. On the evening of the incident I was riding our appaloosa Gelding south from the barn lot toward the back of our farm. Most of our farm had been cleared by dozing eight years before, but the farm behind ours was completely overgrown,with trees,and brush, and it had not been used for anything for several years. The east boundry of our farm was a river, and there are many caves and sink holes in the area due to the karst topography.  As I mantioned above most of our farm was open so visability is good.  I had ridden about 100 yards west of the barn and was within about 100 yards of the back fence when Ace, our horse stopped walking. I kicked him in the ribs a little to get him going again, but he would only go a step or two and would stop again. This went on fow several minutes with me trying to force Ace who was a very well behaved horse to go forward.  I only managed to get him to go perhaps 20 or 30 yards, before he would go no further. All the while he was stamping his front feet, and snorting air out his nose in great puffs,as well as having his ears laid back against his head.  I was getting very frustrated with Ace, and was slapping the reigns against his flanks, and kicking my heels into him,but he would not go. At this time from behind a small cedar tree a large black humanoid  creature stood up, as though it had been crouched there hiding.  It turned toward the back fence of our farm, being just on our side of the fence.  I took four or five long strides walking upright then jumped the fence like a man would jump over something, rather like a great hop. I didn't get a chance to watch what ever it was because Ace turned and bolted back for the barn, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. I was barely able to stay in the saddle he was running so recklessly. I got my father and brother, and we went back to where I saw what ever it was but it was long gone. I remember that it was not covered with long stringy hair as these things are often reported, but was very dark from head to toe.I saw it from about 60 to 70 yards away,clearly with nothing between us until it jumped the fence. It was probably 6:00 to 6:30 pm, but it was only late September so it was still light out at the time.There were other occurrences in this area with screams, or cries at night, the sound of crashing movement in the brush near our house, and a putrid,rotten smell that when smelled while coon hunting would cause the hound to come back to us, and they would slink around at our heels with their tails between their legs. These things took happened over several years, but mine was the only actual sighting of anything, by my family.","classification":"Class A","county":"Greene","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.3317,"longitude":-93.614,"latlng":"-93.614,37.3317","dewPoint":39.85,"humidity":0.87,"cloudCover":0.68,"moonPhase":0.78,"pressure":1011.52,"weatherSummary":"Rain until afternoon.","uvIndex":1,"visibility":7.23,"highTemp":55.72,"midTemp":52.57,"lowTemp":49.42,"precipitationIntensity":0.0134,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":154,"windSpeed":8.02}
{"id":"26694","timestamp":1253750400,"title":"Possible nighttime encounter while camping near Potosi","observed":"Went for a weekend hiking and camping trip with 4 family members.  We hiked about a mile and a half down an established trail before making a turn into the brush to find our camping spot just after sunset on the first night.  we probably hiked about 400 yards into the brush before setting up camp and turning in for the night as it began to rain.  I was woken up about 4:30am by a very strong odor that smelled just like a skunk, so much so that I assumed a skunk had made it into our camp and I zipped up the shell on my sleeping bag to avoid being sprayed.  The odor went away so I relaxed a bit more and tried to get back to sleep when I smelled it again only this time I had an overwhelming feeling I was being watched from directly behind me.  I rolled over to look and was able to make out a sillouette of a very broad shouldered shadow and head between two trees about 7 yards from where I was laying.  I immediately turned around and waited for daybreak, still unsure if I had seen anything or just imagined it I sat waiting and listening for anything aggressive in nature and it didn't happen so I chaulked it up to an overactive imagination but was still uneasy about staying in this location.  I said nothing to my family but I was determined to not let the camp fire die out on the second night.  The second night came and it rained again, we could hear the sound of what I would describe as a very loud owl.  We turned in for the night and all my family fast asleep let the fire get to the verge of dying, easily helped by the falling rain.  Sounds were all around the campsite but not really unexpected in a dry rotting forrest during some steady rains.  I got up to tend the fire and as the firelight grew it seemed the forrest sounds intensified, again probably just nerves.  I'm not an avid outdoorsman but I love the minor amount of time I do get to spend in the wilds.  It was about 3:30am at this time and one of my family members woke up and helped me with the fire, sensing my uneasyness he suggested I use his hammock to get some rest and he would watch the fire.  I got a couple hours sleep and woke up around 5:30am still before daybreak and my family member proceeded to tell me that about 15 minutes prior he heard a very loud crash in the forest and then another less intense crash directly behind the hammock where I was then sleeping.  It had alarmed him enough that he had his handgun out and ready but he said he didn't see anything and I still didn't say a word about what I thought I may have seen the night prior.  I actually did not tell anyone until we were on our way home and I told my brother about what I thought I saw, mostly out of fear of ridicule.  It wasn't until we got home and I started doing some research that I became more convinced of what I think I saw on the first night and what I smelled.  During our time at this campsite the rain stopped during the day and we were able to hike around the area probably covering almost 2 miles and one of things that struck us was the complete lack of any wildlife.  We saw a woodpecker and heard the sounds of birds chirping on the first morning, but that was it, nothing not a single rabbit, squirrel, dear, bird or anything other than that woodpecker and a few fish in a nearby creek were seen in the area.  We did come across some animal droppings that looked almost like rabbit droppings only smoother.  We only stayed two nights even though we had planned on 4 nights total, fearing more rain we left early.","classification":"Class B","county":"Iron","state":"Missouri","latitude":37.66643,"longitude":-90.86792,"latlng":"-90.86792,37.66643","locationDetails":"It was near Bell Mountain, I didn't drive to the area so I wasn't really paying attention to the area.

The first time was on a night time coon hunt. I hunt coons with traps and dogs yet I don't kill them. I let my dogs tree them and I go on to another track with my dog . I had hunted this bottom a night before and my dog was hot on a track deep in the woods bawlen the whole track when he shut up and not a sound from him for twenty minutes. Then all the sudden he came up the creek with his tail between his legs looking back and came straight to me. Ok first this is a hound who has never ran anything but coons and has never stopped tracking with out treeing, anyway, so I thought maybe he got spooked by a bobcat or something so I loaded him up and went home not thinking anything about it. The next evening on the 12th I pulled into the same open field in a bottom where two creeks join. I shined my lights of my truck along the trees of the creeks to see if I could spot some coon and low and behold I saw what I believe was a bigfoot in my head lights at about 75 yards was a enormous blackish brown figure was walking toward the trees through the field to the creek it stopped for a brief moment and just stared at me like it was looking right at me and took large lengthy steps into the woods. I was startled and not only was I startled but my hound in my back seat was startled as well whining and whimpering. I know what me and my hound saw and my dog hasn't ever backed down from an animal as long as I've had it and I've spent countless of hours in the timber with him. [The following was taken from this witness' second BFRO report, after returning to the site :] After talking to the BFRO rep I decided I would go back to the location I had my sighting on the12th, and sat in the exact place I was. Tonight when I got there, there was tracks crossing the road from the north to the south and they were wet and large foot prints. Its 18 degrees here, clearly not a humans tracks. There were 5 prints, one in front of the other, which was rather weird and I do have the pictures of them but their really hard to make out . It was awesome, I got some wood knock responses that were really close across the highway from me, the directions the prints were. I  shined the area and yet I never seen anything. I know what I heard. I'm going to keep squatching the area and a few others to hopefully get a picture of the squatch I saw on the 12th. I consider myself a very very good hunter and I am going to put some of my game cams in the area as well as camo up and sit in the area. I was rather timid tonight on the phone with the BFRO, due to the way people feel about it around here, but I know what I saw and heard.","classification":"Class B","county":"Jackson","state":"Missouri","latitude":39.03445,"longitude":-94.10855,"latlng":"-94.10855,39.03445","dewPoint":24.37,"humidity":0.72,"cloudCover":0.23,"moonPhase":0.09,"pressure":1019.23,"weatherSummary":"Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.","uvIndex":3,"visibility":9.74,"highTemp":40.98,"midTemp":34.17,"lowTemp":27.36,"windBearing":192,"windSpeed":0.44}

Reed Wildlife Area just outside of Lee’s Summit Missouri yesterday, specifically around Bodarc Lake. I was intrigued since the wildlife area is fairly close to where I live. I decided to take some pictures. I crossed the dam over to the south side of the lake where I encountered two men fishing. I spoke briefly to one of the fisherman about the fish he’d caught that afternoon and the weather which was rather threatening. I wished him luck and headed west along the tree line when I encountered the other man. I spoke, but he seemed preoccupied so I walked on. I turned toward the tree line and started taking pictures into the woods after about the fourth picture I heard what I can only describe as a kind of a grunting snorting sound followed by a low but deep growl it was unlike anything I’d ever heard before. It sounded so close, but I didn’t see anything in the woods. I was petrified I turned and headed back towards the two men. I asked them if they’d heard anything one of the men was a little hesitant and really didn’t answer me the other man said yes it was probably a cougar. I told them to be careful and left just before I crossed the dam I stopped to take a picture of a large footprint in the mud. Already shaken by the experience and definitely inexperienced I failed to lie something down beside the footprint to gauge the size of it. But to be honest the only thing I wanted to do was put as much distance between me and those woods as possible. I crossed the dam to my car it was then I heard the same sound coming from across the lake in the vicinity of where I had been. It was muffled because of the distance, but still surprisingly loud that same grunting snorting growl.  The fisherman must have heard it as well because they were coming across the dam at a fairly fast pace. We didn’t speak again they got into their truck, me into my car and we left.","classification":"Class B","county":"Jackson","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.524,"longitude":-94.1927,"latlng":"-94.1927,38.524","locationDetails":"The incident took place in the James A.

As we traveled down E RD Mize Road towards the parking lot area, we were startled when a large creature on all fours crossed the road less than a hundred feet in front of us.  My friend stopped the car and we watched it cross the road from North to South.  It appeared it had come from a field to the right of us. It was covered in dark hair and very muscular. The back was arched and its head was tucked. I didn’t see a tail of any kind. I did however, notice the hair on its back was considerably shorter than it was on the rest of its body. It seemed to just glide across the road which I though was strange since it was very large. I’m guessing it weighed at least five hundred pounds or more. I reached for my camera which was in my lap but the creature had already disappeared. We continued down the road and reached the parking lot where I asked my friend to go back so that we could look for prints, but she refused. I told her I thought we’d just seen a Sasquatch and she told me it must have been a large dog possibly a Newfoundland because they are large black dogs.  I told her that we had a better chance of seeing a Sasquatch in that particular area than a Newfoundland. It was then she told me that she was going to keep quiet about what we had seen and that I should do the same, which obviously I didn’t do. I know what I saw and it wasn’t a dog, a deer or anything I had ever seen before.","classification":"Class A","county":"Jackson","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.5992,"longitude":-94.1057,"latlng":"-94.1057,38.5992","locationDetails":"Monkey Mountain is an 855 acre nature preserve in Eastern Jackson County, halfway in-between Grain Valley and Oak Grove.","dewPoint":52.76,"humidity":0.68,"cloudCover":0.13,"moonPhase":0.97,"pressure":1014.42,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy until evening.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":9.93,"highTemp":73.4,"midTemp":63.74,"lowTemp":54.08,"windBearing":351,"windSpeed":4.36}

{"id":"55672","observed":"I have been keeping this to myself since last year. I have been a deer hunter for over 30 years and wont go back in the woods after what happened. I'm going to bullet point this incident. I was deer hunting. Deer were running around the woods crazy that evening. I had a small buck run past my stand, it was getting dark. 5:30ish. He ran out into the middle of the field and stood there looking at the direction he came from for about 15 min, Then ran off. 10 or 15 mins later I then heard this large something coming through the woods. Small trees breaking and leaves crunching. I had no idea what it was, I had my back against the wide tree 16' in the air, (the tree is wider than my back) and you cant see me or my stand from behind. It stopped right behind me, it is now dark, I could hear it breathing, it was 8 yards behind me, I didn't move, it stood there for about 5 minutes then started sniffing the air like it was smelling for something, then it started to move slightly, it was dry out and leaves covered the ground so you can hear anything move. Then 2 loud tree knocks, I then started to get a chill down my back, as I reached for my bow I heard 2 screams, I had my bow in hand and my shooting trigger was on my bow string and I WAS AT FULL BRAW. The screams vibrated the woods. It stood there pacing behind my tree, left to right then stopped to smell the air again, it started to move West at a regular walk/pace. I let off my bow, reached around the tree, clicked on my head lamp and about 12 yards from me was a 8' tall 700/800lb tall black figure, it grunted when my light came on and ran along the river bank and back into the woods. I did not see a face, I saw the back of IT. I will say this, It was hunting that night, it was smelling for scent and chasing deer, looking for food. At the time my bow was loaded with a 1.5\" expandable broad/arrow head, Yes I was at full draw not knowing what was going on, when my light was on and I drew my bow back again I was ready to shoot if it came back across the stream. I know the exact yards as I have hunted this location for around 5 years, I bow hunt so I need to know the yards for arrow placement. This Sasquatch which what it was, was a massive animal. I don't know if it would harm anyone or persons but the power that I could see it its body was unbelievable. Yes I was scared but I saw something that only a few people in the world have seen.","classification":"Class A","county":"Jackson","state":"Missouri","locationDetails":"I-70 is about 2 miles south from my location"}

{"id":"1100","timestamp":421804800,"title":"Two fisherman run from a large screaming creature in the woods near Highway 7","observed":"This wasn't experienced by me, it was experienced by my father. He related the story to me either later that night or the next day, I don't remember. He and his best friend, Gordon Johnson, often went fishing and (morell) mushroom hunting in the woods near Gordon's house which was just south of town. Gordon had 40 acres, but it was sparsely wooded, and had no fishing ponds. I can't remember whether they were headed for some fishing hole Gordon had heard of or if they were mushroom hunting, but I suspect the latter. The woods they were traveling through were very thick, almost impassible. If I remember correctly, my dad had a machete to hack through the brush. I remember he said that he was having an argument with Gordon, along the lines of \"Where the heck are you taking me!\" After traveling south from the gravel road they'd left my dad's pickup on, he said he found a trail, or at least a spot where the brush wasn't as thick. They started across this spot (I ! remember he said he couldn't tell if it was a trail, or just a cleared out spot) and said they heard a sound that stopped them in their tracks. There had been an eccentric individual that had lived near Gordon who had, a year or so before, let his exotic animal collection loose, which included a lion and lioness. It made all the papers. Despite the fact that all animals had been accounted for, the fact that this sound my father and Gordon heard was a definite roar of some large creature got their attention. In that part of Missouri, bears are unheard of. Forests are pretty much small trees and brush, not the hardwood areas bears like. Same with bobcats, and pretty much any other big game. We have deer and coyotes, and not too many of those. My dad said this was a cross between a lion and a bear, but that it ended in what he described as a high-pitched shriek, like a monkey. Gordon is a pretty superstitious guy, so he totally froze. My dad was more down to earth, he started looking around. They were then hit by a very strong smell, my dad said he almost vomited, he said he was glad he hadn't eaten lunch yet. They heard brush moving (but didn't see anything) and then another howl, just like the one before, but definitely closer. That was enough for them, they turned about face and hauled out at full speed, following the path my dad had cut as best they could. My dad had some nicks and cuts to back up this part of the tale of plunging through the brush (brambles on his clothes and such). They emerged almost 1/2 a mile from where they entered, that's how fast they were running. My father was a construction worker, and just not afraid of much, especially with a machete in his hand. He was also NOT a storyteller, at ALL. If something scared him, he was more likely to lie and say he WASN'T scared, he was quite the macho type. Also, every time he drove past that section of woods to Gordon's house, he always sped up. I could tell something back there got to him. He passed away a few years ago, or I'd call him and get more details for you.","classification":"Class B","county":"Cass","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.7437,"longitude":-94.2633,"latlng":"-94.2633,38.7437","locationDetails":"Cass County, Missouri.

We were both from Kansas City, so it was a second home for them. I had been at the house many times over the years in High School and college. We had always talked about climbing the log flue which was a long scar in on a steep hillside you could see from the Lighthouse Marina looking east across the main channel as the lake makes the turn around the bend. This would be the closest thing to a mountain climbing adventure that the midwest would offer. One afternoon we took his small aluminum fishing boat over to the base of the flue and as we started getting closer to shore and approaching slowly, I kept hearing little pfft sounds in the water around us. Whenever I would look over I would just see bubbles, but no splash so I thought it was some sort of fish. We pulled up to shore and tied up the boat. The hillside was quite steep but still climbable and fully forested with deciduous trees, but not too dense to make walking a problem. Within a few feet of starting to climb and a few minutes of being there, rocks started falling around us coming down through the trees from up above. We did not know what was above us if there were any roads on the high ridge where people would be. So we started shouting up the hill that we were down there, and stop throwing rocks. The rocks were at first half a fist sized, but started getting larger after that, and soon there were football sized rocks crashing through the trees around us, coming downward from above. We quickly got scared and got back in the boat before we got hit by one, since they were large enough to kill us. The smaller rocks continued to fall in the water around us as we pulled away with one or two landing in the boat. At the time we wrote it off as possibly someone having a whiskey still or marijuana patch they were protecting. Although we could never see any smoke in that area or clearings of any sort. After watching Finding Bigfoot a few years ago and seeing how rock throwing is a common trait of sasquatch,  I emailed my friend who still lives near Kansas City, (I moved to California after College) and told him I think it was a Bigfoot encounter we had. Then last night I saw your show from the Ozarks telling about others having Bigfoot encounters with rock throwing, so I thought I would write to you. I am 60 now, but never forgot it. In the 1970s we had heard of bigfoot, but thought they were only in the Himalayas or Pacific Northwest. There was never any talk of Bigfoot in that area, and in fact I never heard any coyotes while in the Ozarks either.  It is still uninhabited there, although many homes have been built in the area that were not there in the 1970s.","classification":"Class B","county":"Camden","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.16811,"longitude":-92.79309,"latlng":"-92.79309,38.16811","locationDetails":"East side of main channel of Lake of the Ozarks","dewPoint":67.55,"humidity":0.72,"cloudCover":0.37,"moonPhase":0.05,"pressure":1011.99,"weatherSummary":"Heavy rain until afternoon.","uvIndex":7,"visibility":8.28,"highTemp":87.76,"midTemp":78.155,"lowTemp":68.55,"precipitationIntensity":0.0816,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":175,"windSpeed":7.04}

I see a humanoid creature on it's hands and knees in front of a big round hay bale. left arm straight down, right arm extended picking up something off the ground. Right knee straight down, left leg extended as if to counterbalance itself. I saw it so clearly that I seen the expression on its face(soft looking, lighter brown hair on the face with a black nose)from a profile angle.

The hair was not matted and seemed to be clean and shiny. I quickly surveyed the surroundings to get a idea of the size of this thing. it's extended arm stretched maybe 2 feet in front of the hay bale, the extended leg probably 3 and a half feet the other way.

They were married in the year 1932.  Shortly there after, they went with their friends, another couple of their age group to a logging camp.  This logging camp was several cabins where two couples stayed per cabin.  The men would leave and go logging during the day.  Then, they returned at evening.  It all started one Saturday night.  The men came in from work and decided to go to town to have a good time, leaving their wives behind.  My mother told me that the other couple had only been married for a short period of time; their names were Frank and Lucy G********.  Lucy was extremely jealous and was afraid that someone would steal her husband, Frank.  It was almost dark when the men left for town.  Lucy was setting on the backporch steps, her arms wrapped around her knees, her head buried into her arms crying.  It was at this point that a curious, hairy man like beast came up to her.  Lucy screamed; the creature fled.  She was the only person in the camp that saw the monster.  She told her story and all the rest of the camp had big laugh.

Dad said he would park his old truck about 200’or so from the cabin.   And the thing, (mom and dad didn’t know what to call it, “this thing” they would call it) would come out of the woods and dad said it would put its elbow on the bed of his truck and rest his chin in his hand.  Mom and dad said it was bigger that a man and had hair all over its body.  They said it looked something like a gorilla.  Dad said it look a little like it didn’t have a head, its head was down in its shoulders.

{"id":"9840","timestamp":1102291200,"title":"Nighttime sighting on country dirt road","observed":"On November 18, 2004  at approximately 6:45 pm, I was traveling south on a winding, dirt road less than 5 miles from my home on C Hwy between McDowell and East Purdy, Mo. As I drove along, I noticed ahead in the ditch line, an animal.  I know that there is a mule that often gets out nad roams the area, so I slowed down considerably so as not to hit her. As I got closer, it stood up, facing my Explorer.  Instead of moving into the headlight beam as a deer or something would do, it came at an angle from the ditch, towards the passenger side of my truck.   It was in my estimate, at least as tall as I am (5'8\") covered with hair.  The hair was a buff or light color. All I really remember at that point is hitting the lock button on my doors and screaming.  It came up to the passenger side window and I could see it's chest.   If I saw the face, I do not recall it, just the chest in the window.   I was screaming and hit the accelorator and sped away as fast as I could.   I don't know what it was, only that I have never seen anything like it before in my life. But, it does make me wonder about events that have happened around our house in the past.  In the spring of this year, my dogs started going crazy barking and I stepped out onto the porch to see what was wrong.   I hear a scream that I took to be  a mountain lion.   Knowing that I had a dog in the back pasture, I went to my truck and went to the back to let her into the main pasture with the other dogs.   I noticed on my way down to the back pasture that my very large dogs had all of my goats in a tight knot by the small barn and the dogs were in a semi-circle around the goats.  When I got to the back, to let the other dog in, I noticed that there was no sound at all in the woods nearby.  My dogs were silent.  The dog that I went down to get was terrified and rushed through the open gate as soon as I opened it.   I went back to the house and went to bed. The next day the neighbor told me that my dogs had fought something behind his house at about 3 am.   He didn't know what it was, only that it was large.  When I checked my dogs out, they did not have the slash cuts they would have had, if they had tangled with a mountain lion.  There were scrapes but that was about it. Our fence at the back of the place was also pushed down.  Our fence consists of cattle panels that are 52\" tall.   They are hooked to the post with heavy wire ties.

{"id":"8429","timestamp":876614400,"title":"Afternoon sighting by mother and daughter in Honey Island Swamp","observed":"My mother and I had taken my young Doberman to the Honey Island Swamp to let him run and get some exercise.  We had driven to the end of the road where the bridge had collapsed and you could not go any further back by car.  The area is a few miles from the Honey Island exit off of Interstate 59 in Mississipi. The road was built up about 8 feet from the ground since it flooded back there.  The area around the road was swampy and had a lot trees.  The ground was covered in leaves since it was fall.  We had been there about ten minutes and my dog had been pretty much just staying on the road as he ran around.  I went to get something out of the car and when I started walking back to where my mother was on the road, she was looking out into the wooded area at something.  She pointed out what appeared to be something dark beside a large cypress tree.  We could not make out a head, but it appeared to be a grey/black fur covered torso.  Whatever we were looking at was large because it stood above some bushes and the top part was behind the branches of the tree.  It had to have been well over 6 feet tall, since the bushes were at least 3 feet tall.  It was definitely not another tree because the texture was so different from the big tree it was next to.  It was approximately 1:00 pm and the sun was bright.  The light was dappled through the tree cover, but we could see that it was shining off of what appeared to be hair or something with a \"hairy\" texture.  It seemed to shift back and forth, as if you were to shift your weight from one leg to another.  It was probably 50 to 75 feet away from us, so we could not get a real good look at it.  We did not hear or smell anything and my dog did not seem to notice anything out of the ordinary.  After looking at it for at least 2 - 3 minutes, we got very uncomfortable and decided that we would drive a mile or so up past one of the bridges on the way back to the interstate.  We put my dog in the car and drove at least a mile up the road before we stopped again to let my dog back out.  We had been there approximately 5 minutes when we heard footsteps in the woods.  We could hear them getting closer.  This time, my dog picked up on the sound and became alert.  We could hear it stop and then move forward a few steps a couple times.  We could not see anything, but my dog was definitely trying to figure out what he was hearing.  We got a little scared, so we loaded up again and this time drove up to where there are some nature trails and a shooting range (probably at least 1.5 to 2 miles up the road).  We got out of the car again and were not there 2 minutes when we heard what sounded like something running through the woods toward us.  At that point, my dog got so scared that he ran back to the car and hit the closed car door to try to get back in.  My mother and I ran to the car and all three of us got out of there as fast as we could.  We never saw what was making the noise in the woods, but whatever it was, was big enough to make a lot of noise both walking and especially running through the woods.  After leaving and having major discussion about what had happened, my mother and I got our nerve up to go back to the end of the road later that day (about 4:00 pm) to see if what we had seen earlier was still there.  When we got there, we could not find what we had seen before.  We saw what we are pretty sure was the big tree, but we didn't see what was by it originally.  We were not brave enough to go down into the wooded area for a closer look, so we basically left with even more questions than we started out with.  We never had a clear view of what we saw, but what we heard, definitely scared us.","classification":"Class B","county":"Pearl River","state":"Mississippi","latitude":30.46825,"longitude":-89.6918,"latlng":"-89.6918,30.46825","locationDetails":"At the end of the road off the Honey Island Swamp exit.

{"id":"1344","timestamp":271209600,"title":"while playing tag with several other children witness saw a white hairy creature.","observed":"Subject: White Bigfoot I just read the Louisiana encounter on your site and thought it great that someone else had seen a white bigfoot. I have not told anyone outside of friends about my experience, although there were plenty of others around at the time. This encounter happened, Ohhh bout 30 years ago in Columbus, MS. I and several of the neighborhood kids were out playing in my front yard. I was the oldest, so the rest of the dozen or so kids were 4th grade and earlier in school. All of us were playing \"Tag\" and to make things level-out for the younger kids, we all were turning round and round to get dizzy so the youngers could have a fighting chance of  catching us. All of a sudden, my youngest brother ran through the group yelling \"Booger-Bear!!\" He looked TOTALLY scared to death. I thought he was joking, but then my next brother did the same while pointing toward the unoccupied side of out duplex apartment house. Soon, I looked around to find that I was the only one left in my front yard, the rest of the kids had run to where the parents where outside chatting next door. All of them were holding onto his/her parent(s). Well, I looked down the street and saw nothing unusual. Looked again, both ways, same result. As I was turning back toward them, my eye caught a movement beside my duplex. Something was standing at the corner, hugging it as though to peek around a corner. It appeared to be slightly hunched over and yet the top of it's head was at the top of the window. The top of that window was at about the 7ft plus level. Could have been higher. One day I might get a chance to measure it cause the house is still there today, although the neighborhood is not where I would care to be at anytime nowdays. Anyway, I stood there looking, trying to figure out what this white hairy thing was. Earlier in the year, maybe a couple of months (been a long time ago), there was a report of a white gorilla that had escaped from a circus. Thing is, kids know when a circus is around in those days, and I had never heard of one being anywhere near. It was just standing there, slightly moving kind of side to side. Since it was at dusk, and I couldn't really tell what this was that I was looking at, I slowly backed over to the grown-ups area. Eventually, the thing was hidden from my view by the house. I eventually worked up enough courage to make a wide arc toward where I saw it to see if it was still there. Nope, it was gone. I had a terrible time sleeping that night. Didn't want to be anywhere near a window even though we had no AC and it was warm weather. Next morning, I went to the area just to see if I could find anything. Nothing. I was never late for supper again. Never stayed out after dark. etc...The experience is real, though I have questioned my brothers about it and they remember nothing. Perhaps it was the grownups playing a joke?  They of course deny any knowledge. This is my only \"bigfoot\" story, though I have a couple of others that may spark some interest, one of which defies any rational explanation.","classification":"Class A","county":"Lowndes","state":"Mississippi","latitude":33.50025,"longitude":-88.40335,"latlng":"-88.40335,33.50025","dewPoint":68.09,"humidity":0.73,"cloudCover":0.48,"moonPhase":0.08,"pressure":1019.41,"weatherSummary":"Foggy in the morning.","uvIndex":8,"visibility":4.81,"highTemp":86.84,"midTemp":78.275,"lowTemp":69.71,"windBearing":349,"windSpeed":3.64}

{"id":"2376","timestamp":999907200,"title":"Young couple encounter a rancid smell","observed":"This is the second report I have submitted. The first was of screams in Arizona where I am living now. This one took place in Jackson County Mississippi in 1973. My father was living in Ocean Springs and working for Littons Ship Systems in Pascagoula. I had joined him there from Arizona when I decided to try my hand at pipefitting instead of Mining. I had bought an acre of land and put a trailer house on it before I had my wife join me. We were on the south side of town in an area of bayous. One night we were at my Dads place playing dominoes when we ran out of diapers for my baby daughter. It was only about a half mile from Dads to my house, so the wife and I jumped in the pick-up and went to the house for more diapers. I had two Red Bone hounds penned in the back of the house and when we got there they were barking as if they had something treed. I was curious as to what they were barking at, as they seldom barked while penned. When I got out of the truck, I noticed a rancid smell coming from the back of the house. I ask my wife what she had given the hounds and she said nothing that smelled that bad. I left the truck running and we went into the house and gathered the new diapers then back to the truck and left. We didn't give it anymore thought that night. I didn't pay much attention when we got back home later, but didn't remember smelling anything then. The next night we were back at my Dads playing dominoes again, and listening to the news from the TV. We heard a report from Pas Christian that a woman had called the police and reported a hairy ape looking man outside her backyard, looking in her kitchen window. She said it was looking over her back fence, which was six foot tall, and she could see it's head and shoulders above the fence. Also, the kicker was that it was accompanied by a rancid smell like rotting meat. The same smell I encountered around my house the night before. Wow, was that weird. I looked around the next morning, but couldn't find any tracks or anything around the house. And there was no smell of rotting meat to be detected. I think we had a close encounter.","classification":"Class B","county":"Jackson","state":"Mississippi","latitude":30.38345,"longitude":-88.72985,"latlng":"-88.72985,30.38345","locationDetails":"South of town, near the gulf about half mile from the ocean.","dewPoint":74.43,"humidity":0.88,"cloudCover":0.4,"moonPhase":0.68,"pressure":1013.51,"weatherSummary":"Heavy rain until afternoon.","uvIndex":6,"visibility":8.4,"highTemp":83.96,"midTemp":78.985,"lowTemp":74.01,"precipitationIntensity":0.0512,"precipitationProbability":0.84,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":116,"windSpeed":3.14}

Probably about 400 yds. into the woods.  I wasn't swimming I was sitting down at the side of the water hole with my feet in the water but kind of drawn up beside me and my sister was sitting between my legs in the water.

I sat there staring at this bush for a good 30 or 40 seconds maybe a full minute, before I realized what it was I was seeing.  There was a face looking at me from behind (between) some branches.  The face was very big, flat, dark brown almost black, eyes were black. I thought at the time that the eyes were looking at me with curiosity or amusement.  It didn't look evil, menacing or well you know. I don't remember a mouth or nose.  I remember the hands being huge, gigantic, the size of baseball mitts.  It seemed like I was looking at it for minutes or longer, but couldn't have been that long, and all of a sudden I was just terrified.  I picked up my sister and screaming ran out of there and everybody just followed me out. I was the only one who saw it, my friends wanted to know why I was so scared.  I told them it was Old Man Walker, (A hermit who supposedly lived way back in the woods, and would shoot at you if he saw you), and they were o.k. with that.  I didn't want to believe what I saw but it defiantly was not an old man. I found it very comforting to know I was not the only one to have seen something so frightening.

First, I like to go conservation areas frequently, and at wire road conservation area off of Grisham ford rd. In Crane,  I was there with a friend it was just after sunset when something would throw very large rocks into the Crane creek. that’s all it consisted of is splashing into the creek.  It sounds like  bowling ball sized rocks being thrown into the water making not only a splash but a “ker-plunk” noise.  This really made me and my friend wonder what was making this noise.  We were very open-minded about what could cause this noise and it happened on multiple occasions, all shortly after sunset when no one else was at the conservation area.  We told several people about this and of course everyone would say its probably just ducks, but like I said the objects in the water were very large making a “ker-plunk” noise like a cannon ball. Just as we finally had given up on the search for the cause of the splashing, months had gone by and me and the same friend went on a float trip. It happened to be the forth of July in 2008.   We planned to float in my canoe on Flat creek from Jenkins bridge all the way to a low water bridge on flat creek road (a very long float).  The float started about mid-day and about half way through the float is was very dark and cloudy so no moon light.  It was just pitch dark on the creek and at a slow deep section of the creek we were just quietly floating along not talking when it seemed like we startled something very large about 20ft. Away. It was just standing in the edge of the creek when we startled it, so it stepped out of the creek. You could hear one leg pull out the water followed by one more, and it displaced a lot of water making waves. It made a couple more steps up on land into a very forested area.  Me and my friend were stunned, just remaining dead silent and starring at the area were the noise originated.  Then, a very large rock was thrown within 5ft. Of the boat, exactly like the occurrences in Crane.  Even though we never saw the creature, It was very clear that it was a large bipedal creature because of the very long strides out of the deep water.  It seems that we startled it, so it walked just out of sight not really frightened though, then it threw a rock to warn us to get away.","classification":"Class B","county":"Barry","state":"Missouri","latitude":36.7279,"longitude":-93.6383,"latlng":"-93.6383,36.7279","locationDetails":"on flat creek past EE hwy. about 2 miles ","dewPoint":67.32,"humidity":0.81,"cloudCover":0.57,"moonPhase":0.06,"pressure":1015.68,"weatherSummary":"Rain in the morning.","uvIndex":8,"visibility":8.67,"highTemp":84.41,"midTemp":76.34,"lowTemp":68.27,"precipitationIntensity":0.0179,"precipitationProbability":0.65,"precipitationType":"rain","windSpeed":1.51}

I hurriedly started the car and put the headlights on.  The first thing we saw was that now the animal was on the passenger side of the car and on all fours as if it were trying to stay out of the light from the headlights.  The animal hurriedly covered the 35 feet in front of the car and into the woods.  It only stood up as it reached the trees. The speed that it moved was amazing.  It was much faster than any deer. It was over 7 feet tall, brown and had a large head though we could not see the face. We quickly left the area and headed back to town. It took over an hour to get my girlfriend calmed down.","classification":"Class A","county":"Callaway","state":"Missouri","latitude":38.62,"longitude":-91.96238,"latlng":"-91.96238,38.62","locationDetails":"dead end county road","dewPoint":50.06,"humidity":0.93,"cloudCover":0.79,"moonPhase":0.81,"pressure":1006.99,"weatherSummary":"Rain starting in the evening.","uvIndex":1,"visibility":6.82,"highTemp":57.7,"midTemp":52.585,"lowTemp":47.47,"precipitationIntensity":0.013,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":165,"windSpeed":4.23}

There we saw the largest footprint I had ever seen in my life.  We looked around for more tracks we could make out beside the one, but we lost the rest in the woods because it was starting to get dark.  The print was long but not extremely wide.

I was about six years old when this occurred. I was asleep in my bedroom one night on the second floor of our home when the neighbor's dog began barking wildly at something in the yard. It made such   that my siblings and I finally got out of bed to see what the commotion was all about. Looking down from our window we saw something in the garden which was right next to the house. There was only natural light, but the thing was only about twenty or thirty feet away and I can still remember it vividly. It was squatting down eating the vegetables from the plants there. I could even hear it eating from where I stood. A moment later we all screamed in surprise and shock at what we saw. It looked up  at us and kept right on eating. I remember that, by its mannerism, it had no fear of us what-so-ever and made no attempt to leave the area or hide in any way. What I remember was a creature that was built like a human being. I can't say exactly  how big it was, but I know it was bigger than the average person. It was covered all over with dark, shaggy, brown hair and when it  looked up at us as we stood in the window its eyes glowed white in the darkness. Eventually my Grandfather woke up and saw it,  too. He went out the side door with his gun and fired up into the air. We continued to watch out of the window and then saw the creature stand up and run off on two legs into the woods toward the river. I remember it ran so fast that I could hardly believe  it. The next morning we found very large human-like footprints in the garden. I had never seen anything like that before and never  have since.","classification":"Class A","county":"Hancock","state":"Mississippi","latitude":30.2464,"longitude":-89.6111,"latlng":"-89.6111,30.2464","locationDetails":"Perlington, Mississippi near Pearl River.

The stories he told went back as far as WWI and included among others, my grandfather and my father. They never got a good look at the thing(my father always attributed it to bootleggers)but my grandfather said whatever it was, it drove lumbermen out of the woods and beat panther hounds so bad that they didn't come home for days. When I was little, I listened to the old people describe the thing and it didn't register in my mind until I got older that it sounded an awful lot like a sasquatch. I've heard there's something in Lousiana, and with all the primitive waterways that cross that two states, I wouldn't be surprised if the two aren't connected. The Burns Booger as they called it has been absent from the area since the sixties when the lumber companies went high tech. This is the same time the last panther was heard in Attala County. My great grandfather and a man were logging in the area after WWI and something frightened them so bad that they quit logging and refused to go back in there. My grandfather and father along with some coon hunters saw something standing by a dieing fire that they had built. They said it looked like a man but then it didn't. (My memory is hazy) on the exact descriptions. My father's coon hounds were known to hunt panther, but something tangled into them one night setting the dogs to howling in pain and terror. Before my father or grandfather could get to them, it was over. The dogs didn't come up for days.

{"id":"1338","timestamp":94694400,"title":"Several incidents in the East Fork Community","observed":"Unfourtunately, I have no video or audio, only personnel observation. The first encounter did not involve a sighting. As a young boy, I was out on the front porch with my mother, father, uncle, and grandfather. At around 9:00 pm, we all heard a sound that was not unlike a shrill human scream. Untill that night, I did not know what it meant to have your hair stand on end. A somewhat large dog that we had outside barked, cried, and ran away in apparrent terror. The only thing we found the next day was a single partial footprint. The next encounter happened when my cousin and I were in the woods fishing at a pond on our grandfathers property. We first noted a very strong odor that we took to be a skunk. We then heard a sound like a scream, a few grunts, then nothing. Before the next encounter, there were some unusual incidents that deserve mentioning. First was the finding of dead livestock, mainly pigs. They almost always had been found with their liver and heart removed. I never saw this myself, only heard the stories. I did see on at least two ocassions all of the fruit eaten off of trees on the property. In both cases, all of the fruit was removed from the trees, and the pits on the ground around the tree. We laughed about the belly ache something would have from eating an entire tree of green pears. Later, as a teenager, I was alone in the woods. I had the distinct feeling I was being watched. I crossed a barbwire fence near the road, crossed the road and entered the woods there. When I returned to the road a short time later, 20-30 minutes, I saw that the fence I had earlier crossed, had been partially knocked down. Upon approaching the damaged fence, I noticed several \"large\" footprints. They appeared human in every respect except for their size. Even then, I wore a size 12D boot, the prints were at least two to three inches longer and maybe two inches wider than my boot. The tracks led first to the road, then back into the woods. Maybe a year later, a friend and I were in the woods. He was from New Orleans, LA, and knew nothing of the past encounters. While near a creek bottom, he suddenly froze and ask me what was watching us. I stood near him and saw what I first thought was a bear about 25 yards away. It was in a squating position. It then stood upright. It was, I'm sure, seven to eight feet tall. The creature was covered with very dark brown hair over it's entire body, with the exception of it's face. It stood upright like a man, not stooped like a bear. As we departed the area, we watched it follow us. The creature had a long stride and it's arms swung as it walked. It followed us to the edge of the wood line. The only sounds it made were whistling noises. My next and last encounter did not occur until I was in the army. A co-worker and I went to the old house to do some shooting. We arrived late that night. As we sat outside talking, we saw a large man shaped creature walk accross the road about 125 yards away. It walked into the woods and disappeared. It did not seem to notice us.","classification":"Class A","county":"Amite","state":"Mississippi","latitude":31.1603,"longitude":-90.71574,"latlng":"-90.71574,31.1603","locationDetails":"All encounters occured in Amite County, Mississippi, in a wooded area about one mile south of Hwy. 23.

{"id":"8999","timestamp":1079222400,"title":"Woman reports riverbank sighting","observed":"I was driving from Columbia Falls to St. Regis Montana to pick up my daughter Jessica. She had spent the weekend with her father who lives in Spokane Washington. It was a bright sunny afternoon either the last weekend of Feburary or the first weekend in March. The time was 3:55 PM on a Sunday. I remember the time as I had just looked at the clock on my dash and we always exchange Jessica on Sunday. We had been following the river for some time and I noticed the ice was breaking up from around the edges and floated down stream. My daughters 15 year old boyfriend was traveling with me. We were traveling west on highway 135 at aproximately 60/65 MPH towards St. Regis. As we started over the bridge that spans the clark fork river I looked to my left as I always do. I like to look for deer and other wild life along the river bank. There is a sand bar that reaches out into the river on the west side and near the tip I saw a very tall (8 to 10 feet) hairy being and a much smaller one. It looked to be right at or just  taller then the knee of the larger one. The larger one was standing about 5 to 6 feet behind the small one with it's arms outstreched and taking a step forward. The small one looked as if it was curious about the chuncks of ice that were near the waters edge as it was leaning forward looking down. The tall one had long reddish brown hair. I remember seeing it flow from the upper arm area, and the hair on it's head and shoulders was also long. It looked silky and shown in the bright sun light. The small one looked to be the same color with shorter hair. When I saw them I said to my daughters boyfriend, \"Look at that!!!\" He said \"WHOA!!\" then we were over the bridge. We looked at each other with our mouths open. We didnt turn around, I think we were stunned and didnt quite believe what we had just seen, maybe a bit scared too?. We didnt talk about it on the way back. After picking up my daughter, the two of them were excited to see each other and talked non-stop in the back seat. I did look at the sand bar on the way back over the bridge which was about 30-40 minutes later, but I didn't see anything. I didnt tell my husband about this until a few weeks ago. I'd been trying to convince my self I didnt really see what I saw. Then one night at dinner I told my family what I had seen. My husband said, \"YA RIGHT!\" My daughter's boyfriend happened to be there for dinner and said, \"Kelly, I remember that, I was there with you!\" He and I hadn't talked about this until that night. I knew then I had to send our siting to the BFRO. I totally believe that what he and I saw was a mother Bigfoot and her young child. I got the feeling in that brief moment, that she was showing her young one something new, allowing him or her to explore. Perhaps her baby had gone too close to the river and she was reaching out as if to say \"that is far enough!\" Just as I have done with my own children.","classification":"Class A","county":"Sanders","state":"Montana","latitude":47.62167,"longitude":-115.3903,"latlng":"-115.3903,47.62167","locationDetails":"To the right of the bridge is a public boat launch on the east side of the river.

I was suprised to see that in addition to the lone tree there was another dark form that was swaying back and forth. I thought to myself, \"thats cool, there's a bear up there\". Then the \"bear\" stood up and walked off the flat area down into a small rocky notch and up some steep rocks then disapeared into the timber. It apeared to cover the distance in about 4-5 strides with very fluid motion. We hadn't spoken yet, only 10-15 seconds had passed. All we could say to each other was, \" I thought that was a bear!\" and to remark that the hair went up on the backs of our necks when the \"bear\" stood up. We hiked back to the truck and had calmed down enough to eat a snack while sitting on the tailgate. We were about 3/4 miles from where we had seen it.

{"id":"1649","timestamp":616291200,"title":"Witnesses hear two powerful vocalizations near their property on the Flathead Reservation","observed":"It has been awhile since this incident happened (1989), but I remember it well. The incident occured during the summer of 1989. I was working in my father's woodshop when my older brother (19 at the time) burst through the door. He was nearly out of breath and very distraught looking. He immediately demanded that I come outside right now. I asked him what was wrong but he just said, \"Come out here right now! Quick!.\" I hurriedly followed him outside. It was late afternoon and the sun was just beginning to wane in the deeper parts of the forest. I asked him what was the matter. He told me to sush, and said \"listen!\" I could here that our grandparent's dog was going berserk. I could also recognize the bark of our dog in the distance as well. I asked my brother what was going on with the dogs and if they were fighting again. He said, \"SHHH! Not the dogs, listen!\" We were both silent, I didn't here anything. I asked him what I was supposed to be listening for. He said he heard something really weird, really freaky. I asked him what it sounded like. He said he could'nt really explain it, just that it sounded really weird. I told him that maybe he heard a mountain lion, as I had heard them on several occasions. They make a really strange sound like an inhuman woman screaming bloody murder. He said it didn't sound like a scream. He took off running down the road towards our grandparent's house calling for me to follow. I ran after him. Halfway to our grandparent's house I heard the sound. We both stopped in out tracks. I yelled to him \"What the hell was that?\" He excitedly replied, \"That's the sound I heard, that's it!\" I had heard a lot of strang sounds growing up in the deep woods over the years (elk mating calls, ruffed grouse beating their wings, coyotes, etc.), but never anything like this. I can't really describe the sound except that it was a high-pitched tone from a living thing that was very resonant, powerful, and well controlled in its execution. It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. Soon, whatever it was out there in the woods ahead of us made the sound again, this time for a shorter duration and slightly broken. Another period of silence (other than the dogs going nuts). We continued running towards our grandparent's house. We soon arrived where the dogs were. Our dog was standing next to our grandparent's dog which was tied up. They were both looking and barking into the forest in the direction we had heard the sound coming from. I had never seen them bark like this, not even at bears. All of sudden, we heard a similar sound come from a completely different direction of the woods on the opposite side of us. Immediately the call was answered by another loud report where we originally heard the first sound. Whatever was out there, there seemed to be two of them and they seemed to be communicating. We continued to listen. Nothing for a minute or two. Then we heard two more distinct calls, this time from the same general direction in the woods, yet seperated. They were now coming from a farther distance. Again they seemed to be replying or communicating to one another. We continued to listen for several minutes, but the sounds did not occur again. We told our family members about it but no one really paid much attention as they had not heard the sounds and since we lived right in the middle of an area used by bears and other animals to travel through the wilderness regularly (the tribe caught 7 bears in one summer using live bear traps near our house!) they probably assumed it was just some animal out in the woods. In any case, I have never forgotten the incident and often think of the surreal event every time I go back to the wilderness.","classification":"Class C","county":"Missoula","state":"Montana","latitude":47.03222,"longitude":-114.0906,"latlng":"-114.0906,47.03222","locationDetails":"It was in Montana on the Flathead Indian Reservation,near an area known as Evaro.

I thought that was odd so I went and sat on the back porch. Then I saw the tree to my left move and the tree was about 300 yards away from me or less I am bad with measurements.  So I watched the tree to see what caught my eye and then I saw the creature.  It was behind the tree looking out from behind it.  It's head was in the banches and it was hunching.   Is's head was large and it had a definate brow I thought I was seeing an oranatang.  Except it was about 6 and ahalf feet tall.  It was moving it's head aroud the tree to watch me as I stood up to get a better look. It's hair was a rust color like to color of dead pine needles, It's eyes were haunting. And it was completely silent.  It was watching me while I was watching it.  I sat back down.  I watched outside for about 6 minutes and didn't tell the person on the phone. Then I went in the house and watched throught the window to make sure it wasn't a trick of shadow.  Then the creature moved in front of the tree, staying hunched over but watching me in the window. I watched a few more minutes and then went to the back of the house when I went back it was gone.  While this was going on my kids were in the front yard playing in the water.  I think if the creature had been aggressive it would have made some sort of move. but it d=seemed peaceful. It seemed to be curious I think it was young to be in such a vulnerable open area.

The other witness is a Deputy Sheriff.   Both of us are in our mid-thirties, married and have children.  Neither of us however, drink, use drugs, or in any way were incapacitated during the time of the 'sighting'. It would also be relevant to tell you that I grew up in Washington where I spent countless summers camping, hiking, and enjoying the outdoors.  My good friend grew up in Oregon and spent a great deal of time hunting, camping and recreating in the outdoors. We both now live in Missoula, Montana and have never heard the sounds like we did last night, on 01/23/2005. My buddy and I returned from a coffee at Barnes and Noble and he was dropping me off in my driveway near 2030 hours.  The moon was pretty full last night and it was cloudless, so visibility was pretty good.  Behind my new home, which sits on nearly two acres, is a large hill that descends on the other side to a partially wooded area in a canyon where deer are seen all the time.  The heavier, more dense forest starts less than a mile away, and in fact heads into the mountains. As we conversed in my driveway, the COMPLETE silence was broken by this god-awful howl/growl/moan that echoed the whole valley. The volume was overwhelming.  Immediately, my dog, as well as multiple dogs on the road, began barking and almost seemingly panicked.  Now please let me tell you that we get elk, deer, bear and mountain lion around here pretty consistently, but never any reaction from the dogs like this. We went behind my house where my dog was no longer barking, but instead just shivering and looking up at the hill - just as 'it' did it again.  The sound is so incredibly similar to the 'howl' you have on your site that it is eerie. A third series of growls (and let me tell you they were deep and extremely loud) soared across our neighborhood. I let my dog have refuge in his fenced kennel where he retreated to his doghouse.  My dog is a year old lab who has grown up exposed to many wild animals. We waited but the noise finally stopped after 1-2 minutes.  We both commented on how the hair on the back of our necks were sticking up and that neither of us had heard ANYTHING like that before in all our years. My friend left and I headed into the house where I felt compelled to load hollow point slugs into my shotgun.

We were on the old Indian highway heading west and then we drove about one fourth mile past the Stiffarm's residence and turned South down a road that dead ends after about another quarter mile. Montie's brother said to let him off at an irrigation canal that ran due east/west he was to walk all the way east until the open field on his left and the brush on his right ran into the trees. The trees that the irrigation canal ran into was a \"deep\" woods area that hardly anyone went into, mainly because it was owned by a non Indian and partly because it was a little spooky and quiet. Monty , Shawn and myself stopped the car at the turn around spot and got out. We then headed South and crossed a barbed wire fence and got on another irrigation canal ( parallel to the one Monty's brother was on). It was about 5:30 PM just about enough time to get a deer and get out before dark. We started walking east and passed a block of brush to the left and came upon an open field. Monty said that he was going across the fields to the east, right below were his brother was and start flushing in the brush that was all on the east border of the field. We bid him good luck, and continued on. I told Shawn to set up on the south east corner of the field next to the irrigation canal and wait to see if one of us flushed something. I continued on and went pass the block of brush Monty was in and turned North. The river was on my right and the brush was on my left, and I started walking up the lane. About this time, I knew that I had miscalculated the light and it was getting dark fast. The road up ahead was dark and it went into the \"thick forest\", right at the point were the irrigation canal that Monty's brother was on entered the woods. I was walking slow listening and then all of the sudden right in front of me about 100 yards ( sound guess) there was this horrible and very loud screaming. The sound was deep and had gurgling noises mixed in with a hooting like a chimpanzee. The sound was right on top of were I had mentally placed Monty's brother to be. I was told by our elders to stand your ground as a warrior if one of those ever came to you. I looked at the .22 in my hands and a broad yellow streak went up my back. I spun around and took off back to the canal. I ran around the corner and about 150 feet later ran into ( almost literally) Shawn. He said later he almost shot me, and we ran west on top of the canal. We stopped about right in the middle of the field on our right and spotted something running towards us from about were Monty went in the brush. Shawn said \" should I shoot it \", then I said \"yea\". Shawn drew up his gun and was taking aim when he decided to wait a few more seconds. Its a good thing because Monty came running all out of breath, and said \"do you guys hear that?\". All the while it was continuing to scream, gurgle and hoot unlike anything I have ever heard. We ran all the way back to the car and piled in. We took off north and met Monty's brother already standing on the road. He was shook up pretty bad and we asked him what happened. The weird thing was that he never told us, then, nor later on. Monty though it was us for about 2 seconds and then decided based on sheer terror that no human could make those sound that long. It was definitely the closest and most chilling, as far as immediate danger goes. I never saw Monty or his brother after that, and even my brother and I don't talk about it much. I am spooky about the military, because the people that filmed them in this location before were professionals, and the Indians I talked to said that they even got daylight footage, yet nothing was ever in the news. They even had pictures of a group of them, yet nothing.... That is why I am spooky about it.","classification":"Class C","county":"Roosevelt","state":"Montana","latitude":48.03278,"longitude":-105.8642,"latlng":"-105.8642,48.03278","locationDetails":"On the Missouri river bottom approx. 30 miles East of the FT.Peck Dam.

As we approached the straight stretch, just before you reach the town of Quitman, we saw a creature walk from the bushes on the right side of the highway onto the road.  It didn't see us or didn't look at us until it reached about the center line, then it paused, looked at us, and then continued on across the road and into the woods on the other side. The creature was very tall, with long arms.  It had reddish brown fur (?) all over.  When it looked at us, its eyes reflected the headlights of our car.  It walked upright, with a pretty natural gait, almost fluid in its movement.  We had been talking about the game on the way home, but when we saw whatever it was, we both stopped. I slowed down the car as I got to where it crossed and I know the hair stood up on my arms. It still does today when I tell the story again.

{"id":"35789","timestamp":1287619200,"title":"Possible wood knocks heard by a photographer near Quitman","observed":"At the time of this occurrence we had been at Clarkco State Park for two nights in a cabin. The previous morning, Wednesday, October 20, 2010, I had walked the length of the cabin road to its dead end, turned around, and then walked the length of the cabin road all the way across the dam to the park headquarters building.   During this time I shot photos of leaf colors, a duck on the water, and various other things.  Nothing unusual was seen or heard that morning (morning of Wednesday, October 20, 2010). The following morning (Thursday, October 21, 2010) I awoke around 730AM.  My wife was still asleep.    I had a bite to eat, put on my clothes, got my digital camera, and headed out on the road towards the dam of Clarkco Lake to get some early morning photos.  The time I left the cabin was about 815AM CDT. The temp was down around 45 degrees that morning and there was a light fog coming off the lake.  The morning was completely clear – brilliant sunshine - with no overcast and some light breezes now and then. I tried to sneak up on some turtles that were out on a log to shoot a photo, but they were too quick for me.   All of them slipped into the water.  I shot a few photos of the lake, leaf colors, and the fog from the south end of the dam (the end away from the park headquarters building). After shooting several photos I headed back to the cabin on the road that led away from the dam.   When I was about 150 feet from our cabin I heard a distinct knocking sound like you would get if you were hitting a 2x4 with another 2x4, or maybe hitting a 2x4 with a hammer.   I thought there might be some carpenters doing some work at a house located nearby.   However, we were inside the state park and I knew of no houses – other than the ranger houses - within the park.    This knocking sound continued on.   I didn't count the number of \"knocks,\" but I'd say they numbered at least ten knocks and were in a steady rhythm. I stopped walking and looked directly into the wooded, hilly area in the direction the sound seemed to be coming from (towards the south).   The knocking stopped when I stopped walking.   I saw nothing and heard nothing while I was stopped on the road.   There were no odors in the air at this time either.   As mentioned above, there was a light breeze blowing from time to time that morning.  I then proceeded to walk to our cabin which was only about another 75 feet away.   As I began to walk the knocking sound started again and this time I attempted to count the knocks.   There were five or six knocks in a steady rhythm.  Then there were no more. When I got into the driveway of the cabin I again looked in the direction that I thought the sounds came from and saw nothing. Could this sound have come from construction work between the state park and U.S. Highway 45?   Could there have been a utility company crew working in the woods on a power line? I have been in the woods for years as a Scout leader, a camper, and as a hunter, I have heard woodpeckers and other animals make noises before.   This was not a woodpecker.   It was not a deer hitting a tree with his rack.   This was a heavy and deliberate sound.  This knocking sound was unlike any animal sound I have ever encountered. There were no \"whoops,\" \"calls,\" or other noises, just the wood knocking sound.   The knocking was a \"hard\" sound almost like a carpenter hitting a piece of wood repeatedly with a hammer in a steady rhythm.   That's one of the reasons I lean towards it being a sound from a construction site.    However, the fact that the knocking stopped when I stopped walking and looked into the woods, and then resumed when I began walking again, makes me think there are other possibilities as to its origin. After coming home from the state park I listened to wood knocking sounds on the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website.   The wood knocking sound I heard exactly matches the recorded wood knocking sounds on some of the bigfoot websites.  Again, the sound was similar to hitting two 2x4s together or pounding on a 2x4 with a hammer. During midmorning of that same day we left the state park and went to Meridian for a few hours.    My wife was not feeling well when we returned, so when we got back to the state park we packed our belongings in the car and headed for home.   We had paid for three nights at the park, but we only stayed two nights.  We left the park around 330PM CDT that day.   I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary the remainder of the time we were in the state park. The GPS coordinates where I was on the cabin road when I heard these knocking sounds are approximately: N  32 degrees, 5 minutes, 53 seconds     W  88 degrees, 41 minutes, 44 seconds.","classification":"Class B","county":"Clarke","state":"Mississippi","latitude":32.09515,"longitude":-88.68893,"latlng":"-88.68893,32.09515","locationDetails":"Clarkco State Park is located just off US Highway 45 about four miles or so north of Quitman, MS.","dewPoint":45.6,"humidity":0.63,"moonPhase":0.45,"pressure":1017.2,"weatherSummary":"Clear throughout the day.","uvIndex":5,"visibility":9.48,"highTemp":81.9,"midTemp":63.3,"lowTemp":44.7,"windBearing":297,"windSpeed":2.96}
{"id":"30384","timestamp":277776000,"title":"Cousins view a large biped figure on opening day near Virginia City","observed":"On the morning of October 21, 1978, my dad, uncle, cousin and I awoke in preparation for opening day deer season. After spending the night in my Grandfathers cabin up Alder Gulch, we geared up for an early morning hunt. My cousin and I rode in the back of my uncles pick-up truck with my dad riding shotgun. We planned on hunting the ridge to the west of my Grandfathers cabin. We had to drive about 2 miles south or as I would call it (up) Alder gulch to get to the road that goes to the ridge. We missed the turn to the ridge road, but quickly realized our error. Upon finding the correct road we progressed up the gradual slope climbing and meandering through mostly pine and some meadows dominated by waist-high sage brush. Of course, being opening deer season my cousin and I were being vigilant scanning every opening and meadow. My cousin and I were hanging on to the cab of my uncle's truck due to a slight uphill grade. To our right was an open hillside meadow covered with thigh high sage brush surrounded by pine trees. We both were scanning the meadow when my cousin said, \"there's another hunter, (slight pause) why is he wearing all black?\" All I could do was stare and keep staring. My cousin looked over at me because I had not said anything. We both viewed the animal for about 10 seconds. About 250 yards out in the sage brush meadow was a bigfoot. We banged on the cab so my uncle would stop. The pick-up came to a quick stop and as luck would have it, there were pine trees blocking our view from the sage brush meadow. We immediately said to back-up. As we backed up my cousin and I expected to see the bigfoot still in the meadow but there was no sight of him/her.  We both looked at each other in disbelief and questioned each other as to what we saw. Make no bones about it the animal had the distinctive dome shaped head with no neck broad shoulders and solid black. The animal was facing us and slightly bent forward and looked as if it was resting it's right arm on it's right knee. It occurred to me that he/she knew it got caught out in the open and was just going to stay motionless and hoped we would drive right by. The closest tree line was about 50 yards away from the big foot and it had taken us only about 15 seconds to get back to were we could see the sage brush meadow again. We didn't see the big foot again.  We didn't tell our dads until later on and just kept it to ourselves. My cousin and I continued to hunt deer that morning with a constant thought in the back of our minds of what we saw earlier. We did separate from each other as we hunted the ridge and I did get an eerie feeling that I was being watched. Hustling to find my cousin down the ridge and put the feeling of being watched behind me I heard a gun shot. My cousin did get a nice mule deer buck. This was about 2 to 2 1/2 miles from our sighting. I have hunted most of my life and have seen most animals that live in these woods. My cousin has been hunting all his life and knows every animal there is in these woods as well. We will never forget that morning and talk about it with each other occasionally.  I hope to possibly get another chance to witness another big foot and get one on video.","classification":"Class B","county":"Madison","state":"Montana","latitude":45.12266,"longitude":-111.563,"latlng":"-111.563,45.12266","locationDetails":"Upon entering Virginia City via Hwy 287, take a right if your coming from Nevada City, or a left if you came in from Ennis, up Alder Gulch.

A call(scream) began and rose and fell over the length of about 10 seconds that silenced all 5 of us and everything in that forest.  The hair on my neck stood up.  Then it repeated. A few minutes later, we heard it again. It sounded like it was coming from the ridge above us. Starting like the growl of a bear, it rose slowly in pitch and strength over the 10 seconds until it peaked in a howling high-pitched scream. A survey was taken and no answers were to be found as to its origin. The next day, we summited and on the descent we discovered a cave only about 15 feet deep and lined with dead pine needles. No discussion was ever made by any of our party until a few years ago. Last summer while car camping with my son not far from the first incident, we heard rocks being pounded together just after dusk.

{"id":"1530","timestamp":240537600,"title":"Fly Fisherman sees a hairy bipedal creature while trout fishing","observed":"I had hiked downstream on the Missouri River from Hauser Dam for an evening of flyfishing for rainbow trout. This was during August, 1977. As usual, I kept fishing until well after dark. About 11:00 p.m., there was no moonlight and it was so dark I could only see a few feet in front of me. I had a large flashlight/lamp with me which I laid on a large boulder with my flybox. Just below the boulder, I placed some rocks in a circle near the river's edge to put my trout so they would keep fresh. I was fishing about 20 yards upstream of the boulder that held my lamp when I suddenly realized that I had lost my fly. I proceeded back towards the boulder to put on another fly. As I approached the boulder I could see some kind of movement but it was too dark to make out what it was. When I reached the boulder, I switched on my lamp with the beam pointing above the boulder towards some brush up the steep embankment. I was startled to hear a crackling sound and see movement from the brush. I pointed the beam directly at the movement only 10 feet from me and got a full view of a hairy bipedal creature moving very rapidly up the bank and quartering away from me in the downstream direction. It was very large and muscular with long dark hair and seemingly no neck. Estimated height is about 7-8 feet, guessing 400-500 pounds. I could not see its face as it was moving away from me. It took long, powerful strides and its arms moved powerfully as a man would walking very rapidly. It was amazing to see how quickly it traversed over the boulders and up the steep embankment. I had the creature in the lamp beam for only a few seconds before it disappeared into the darkness. I was stunned at what I had just seen and tried to rationalize what it could have been. For some strange reason, I felt absolutely no fear. The sense I had was that this was an animal of some sort that was frightened away by my light and posed no threat to me. However, that changed somewhat when I shined the lamp towards the rock pool where I had been keeping my trout. Before the sighting of the creature, I had four trout ranging from 2 to 3 pounds in the pool. After the sighting, there were only two trout. This explained the movement I detected as I was approaching the boulder. The creature must have been innocently foraging along the river's edge and found an easy meal. What caused me some concern was that the creature might come back and fight for the remaining two fish. Then I heard a boulder crashing down the hillside, probably several hundred yards down the river. I therefore felt some comfort that the creature was still running away from me. At that point, I picked up the two remaining trout and hiked back up to Hauser Dam and crossed the river to my vehicle and went home.

It was a very warm fall day when my cousiins and myself decided to some huntng on horseback. The area that we hunted was the foothills of the rockies on the Blackfeet Reservation in Big Sky Country. We had decided half way into the trip to just take a ride a wait for lady luck to bring us something during the ride. All day was pretty good as far as the ride went but I know that everybody still had the idea of getting a deer on their mind. We had decided to ride hime through a brushy trail hoping to run into some game before we made it home. Most of the day was gone and the evening sun was warimg our backs as we made our way home. As we approached the trailhead my cousins horse was relectent and fought the briddle bit for awhile. We thought it was just because of it being green broke. Once inside the brush a good ways into it our horses started stepping very softly and snorting once in awhile as if something didn't agree with sence of smell. I could see the opening of the trail and it would also be the end of the trail. One of my cousins was just about to say something when our horses began jumping in different directions like they were scared of something, the first thing on all our minds was, A BEAR! We began looking in different directions trying to get find the location of the bear. I don't rememder who was the first to sight what it was we saw, I just heard him swear and ask the rest of us to look. We looked in the direction he was pointing and saw this very tall thing running on two legs beside us and then turned in front of us. The thing crossed the trail in front of us about 40 feet and stopped at the edge of the brush, it just stared at us as if in the same amount of amazement as we were, and then just disappeared into the trees just as fast. The best way I can describe it as probably the hairiest man I have ever saw well past 6 feet tall. It was hard to determine the size but the branches the we found broke the next day were from 6 feet to about 8 feet in some places some foot print were found in places where the ground was soft and along the trail we followed towards the mountians.

{"id":"1454","timestamp":739065600,"title":"Three backpackers see a large, massive upright animal running on two legs through the brush in Gallatin Nat'l Forest","observed":"Two friends and I were backpacking in the summer of 93'. We were going to hike the Gallatin divide that summer, one weekend at a time. We started south of Bozeman and planned to finish in Yellowstone latter that summer. This was our third weekend and it being a Sunday we were hiking out to our car which was parked at the Portal Creek access. It was getting late in the day and it looked like some weather was rolling in. We were coming down the west side of windy pass so we decided to double time it so we weren't exposed in the weather. We didn't make it to the tree line before the storm hit us. The wind was howling and a nasty mix of rain/hail came down on us. When we were well enough below tree line we decided to sit out the storm by this rock out cropping. Wind whipping through the hills, especially in a rocky area like this, has a very distinct sound. It seemed like there was something else in that in that howl. Something that didn't quite sound like it was part of the wind. No one commented on it but I could tell by how Dan and Kevin were looking around that they heard it too. After about 45 minutes the wind died a bit and only a slight drizzle was falling. We started hiking back down, the clouds were clearing and it looked like we were gonna get a good view of sun setting over the Spanish peaks. We were coming through this clearing that had been cut maybe ten years ago. The sun was almost out of sight when we heard some thrashing across the clearing. It could have been almost anything but since we were in bear country Kevin took out his .357; not enough to stop a determined grizzly, but it was better than nothing. We proceeded slowly across the clearing. It was maybe a hundred yards towards to older tree line, with a lot of scrub and young pines in between. I was looking up for circling carrion when I heard this howl. It sounded like what I had heard earlier but now the wind wasn't behind it. It sent a chill up my spine. Dan, who was behind me yelled something to the effect of \"holy [#*$%]\" and pointed off to our right. Something massive and dark and clearly running on two legs ran through the brush about sixty yards away and disappeared into the forest.

{"id":"21907","timestamp":1269043200,"title":"Possible sighting and wood knocks heard near Swan Lake","observed":"I am not sure that I had sighting. The reason I am writing this is because I listened to the \"Whoops and Knocks\" recording from CA, and it reminded me of what I heard while I was hunting on Tuesday afternoon. I was hunting with friends in the Swan Valley of MT. I do not know the exact location, because we were in the backwoods, and traveling on back roads off of Highway 83. We were on the east side of the highway north of Condon and I beleive south of town Swan. My Partner and I split up (our other partner was in his truck up the road). He was to my left 150 yards and in front of me by 200 yards. I saw something brown in the corner of my eye pass behind a tree to my right, hoping it was a deer or elk, I started to head in that direction. My partner contined heading toward and through a ravine. I would walk, and then stop for about 10-20 seconds looking around. I kept hearing a knocking sound. I thought it was a very close woodpecker, but could never see one.Plus it was really loud. After I decided that I must of lost the deer or elk, I decided to head down into the ravine my friend has been went through about 5-10 minute before me. The knocking sound became loud and I was sure that it just was very loud wood pecker, or deer ruttings(The rut is not for a couple of more weeks). The sound always came from the right of me. After hearing knocks on the recording in the Seirra Mountains, I am about 98% sure that is what I heard. Wood or something hitting wood, which also explains the volume and pacing of the knocking. I walked down into a ravine and it got a littel louder. Then all of sudden the knocking just stopped. I decided to go find my partner and walked out the ravine to the other side. I could not find him, so I went back through the ravine, and heard more knocking.I walked back somwhere between 1/2 to mile to our drop off point on the road (I came out about 100 ft to right of the spot), and thought I heard and elk call (which none of my partners heard) but sounds very much like the whoop call after the 1/2 point of the recording. The two men I was hunting with are expereinced hunters and in the woods. It was my second time hunting.  I told them about what I thought was the elk call, and neither of them heard it. When I heard it I was probably atleast 1/2 mile from them. I did not mention the knocking, because I though it was bird, and no big deal. I have hiked/backpacked in Tenn,CT,NC,AZ, The Cascades in WA, Grand Coulee Dam Area of WA, and enjoy being in the woods. This is my first time that anything like this has happened.

We hiked about a mile and a half up into the mountains and about half way up, we crossed a little creek about 4 to 5 feet wide. I stopped and pulled out my phone to take a picture of the upstream view. I got the picture and we continued on without realizing what he had just done. Later that night I was going through the pictures of that days hike, when I came across something in one of the pictures that was extremely startling. About 45-50 feet from where I took the picture, there was a black figure that seemed to be sitting near the bank of the creek looking right as us. Curious about what I had seen, a few days later when my father arrived to visit my brother, I took him to the place I had taken the picture. Sure enough, where there had so clearly been something sitting next to the creek, there was nothing. In fact there were even freshly broken branches off trees that were no where near the spot it was sitting.

There was a complete trail of these bi-pedal tracks leading around the face of the mountain. I've taken a picture of a track with my boot next to it as a point of reference as to the size of the track. My boot measures exactly one foot, and four and half inches wide, and my average step is about three feet. I am six foot and one inches and had to leap to reach each track. I'm guessing it had a rough estimate of a five foot step, which were heading north, north east up the mountain. I know it wasn't a snowshoe because snow shoes are so long that they overlap themselves, and have a hinged claw in the middle for traction which these tracks showed no sign of. Each step was long and clean, bearing no signs of drag. I guessed the tracks to be about 4-5 days old. I side hilled the mountain heading south, then down to the road back north, only to see my tracks being the only ones up off the road since it snowed. I've never crossed another person's tracks up there before, since its a pretty secluded area that has hidden lakes for the willing hiker. But never a track like this one ever.

My job was to deliver railroaders to their train.   Or to move crews from one train to the other.   A few months ago, I saw something that just wasn't right.   No crew in the van because I'd been called to the coal mine to move one crew from a train to another train at the mine. On the way out there, it's a long lonely road at night.   I dropped down over the Decker hill and something was walking along the right hand side of the road.   There's always Indians, \"Native Americans\" walking out that road looking to get a ride.   That's what I thought I saw.   But it walked across the road in front of me.   I had to hit the binders hard.   It wouldn't look at me.   Just stood on the left shoulder of the road.   It did kind of look over it's shoulder at me but I didn't get any facial features.   It swayed when it turned. I did notice that it had long hair, almost like it was groomed. Probably 8-10 inches long.   Couldn't tell you what color it was because it was almost midnight and it was in the headlights. The next day, I had to make a daylight run.   I stopped and measured bushes, fence, and such.   This thing was at least 8 feet tall.  I looked for hair on the barbed wire, or tracks.   Nothing. This happened in the old town of Decker Montana.   Decker was moved with the coal strike.   I remember where the old town was.  When you are driving North, you drop over a hill and the town was on the left.   My mother in law used to have the restaurant.   But it's gone now.   However, this is where I encountered him/her when I dropped over the hill. I did see deer before and after the sighting.

The creek bottom is heavily forested,and a dense crop of a bamboo like reeds grow along the bottom. I was leaving the woods,but stalking slowly along a logging road. As I started up a hill,a doe deer that was bedded down just above the reed cane (on the side of the hill),jumped up and headed for the thick cover of the reeds. The deer was angling to my right,and down into the reeds. I quickly got to higher ground,above the reeds,in hopes of seeing the deer as she slipped through the reeds. As I was watching her white tail waving through the thick,green and brown cover,something to my extreme right moved,and on the other side of the creek. I could not really understand what I was seeing. I saw a tall,(in comparison to the reeds,which grow at least 4-6 ft tall)figure moving away from me,and it appeared to be dark,and sort of mottled in color. The mottling was not in highly contrasted colors,but simply darker shades of brown,and slightly lighter shades of brown.Maybe it was the effect of the sun filtering through the leaves. It was the early part of the deer season,and the leaves had not fallen entirely. I estimate the distance to maybe 50 yards. Being above the reeds,was the ONLY way I could have seen this. As I watched it move through the woods,it appeared to have what I would call a hump on it's back,and I only saw that when it turned and looked in my direction,as it pushed through the vegetation. I had the perception that it went through some very heavy limbs,as I saw them snap back once it was through. It did not seem to be running,but moving quickly,and with no need to duck or dodge the vegetation.It just pushed through it. I will admit,that I was unbelievably unsure of what I had seen.I was scared to be honest. At that time,and as it is now,black bears were NOT known to inhabit that part of our state. And,black bears do not walk very far in an upright manner.This was upright. I did not go back into that bottom again.

I was armed with a heavy caliber hunting rifle,and armed with a .44 mag. revolver,and I would not venture back in there again I have seen no tracks on the creek bottoms,or around muddy spots,that we could not identify.

The snow and ice had stuck around for several days and was quite deep in this secluded section of the trail.

These footprints continued intermittently (because there were patches of rock and solid ice as well as snow)for about a mile and a half of steep trail. The tracks were headed North on the trail (in the same direction that I was headed). Since I was alone and would be spending the night alone, I convinced myself that the  tracks were simply the work of hoaxsters. I could not allow myself to become frightened by what I saw by believing in their reality. I also refused to let myself take a picture of the tracks, as that would lend credibility to them in my mind (remember- I was backpacking totally alone and unarmed). The tracks were slightly larger than my hiking boots (which are rather large- i would say the tracks were approximately 13 inches in length). After my excursion, I wish I would have taken pictures of the tracks, as I feel someone trying to propagate a hoax would have had to be incredibly committed to hike into that difficult terrain and plant the tracks on those incredibly steep and treacherously icy switchbacks.

That was almost 30 years ago and haven't seen or heard anything since.","classification":"Class B","county":"Yadkin","state":"North Carolina","latitude":36.134,"longitude":-80.66,"latlng":"-80.66,36.134","locationDetails":"Farmland 5 miles east on Courtney Huntsville Rd. off of Highway 601","dewPoint":50.72,"humidity":0.99,"cloudCover":0.99,"moonPhase":0.69,"pressure":1016.11,"weatherSummary":"Light rain in the morning.","uvIndex":1,"visibility":1.54,"highTemp":54.66,"midTemp":48.1,"lowTemp":41.54,"precipitationIntensity":0.0216,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":271,"windSpeed":3.42}

I knew what it was. About a mile up the road ends, I knew I had to come back down. I was so scared to go back down but I knew I had to. I was driving pretty fast back down and did not look anywhere, just eyes on the road. I did not want to see him again. Have not been up there since this story I'm about to tell you is why I'm getting a hold of you guys. My little brother and my little sister and her boyfriend went hunting above Dixon. They ran into some elk and my little brother shot one. They were siting there gutting it out when a big rock was thrown on to the road. They said the rock was big, at least a 100 pound rock. They said the rock did not roll down, it was thrown. There is a lot of people around here that have seen and heard stuff too.

I was ready to get in my truck and investigate the screaming but the screams were not human.  All of the horses in my boarding pens were snorting and looking west toward the river.  My Australian shepherd dog was also acting very strange; growling and his hair was standing up.  A large number of whitetail deer lived along the river and routinely came down to my place to feed on any hay left over on the ground.  They were a real nuisance. I did not see or hear anything else but I will never forget that sound and the way the horses were acting; similar to smelling a bear.

{"id":"1519","timestamp":394243200,"title":"Boys observe hairy man-like creature several times","observed":"It all started in the summer of 1982. Mt .St. Helens had erupted earlier about a year or so before. Myself and my cousin my brother and a family friend decided we would go hiking. Me and my friend were both 15 at the time and my cousin was 14 and my brother was 13. We went into the woods carrying nothing but BB Guns. We could not see nothing at the time. But I had been hiking in those woods about 5 years by myself or with my brother and I never had a care in the world.This included a run in with a grizzly. I felt as if we were being watched. For some reason the hair on the back of my neck even stood up. We could not see anything at the time so we continued on. Well a thunder storm started in and we started back towards my cabin. I gues we went out about 2 miles before we had to start back. I still feel as if something or someone was watching us. I just knew it. But whatever it was did not make a sound nore would it let us see it. Well we kept on and finally we heard something in the woods ahead of us. Well we stopped and to be honest were scarred so we stayed put for awhile and just listened.Well the noise stopped and we continued back towards the cabin this time a little faster than normal. Well when we finally broke out of the woods about 400 yards from the cabin I looked towards the end of the woodline and I saw a fiqure standing up and looking at us. My friend also saw it as well as my cousin, and my brother. It was black in colour and looked to be at least 6 foot tall. It was about 200 yards away from us so we did not know if it was a bear. well we went back to the cabin and told our parents what had happened and they had no explanation for it. My mother grew up there and she had no idea. Well about two days later we got brave again and on a bright sunny day our same group headed out in the same area. Well we got about 300 yards in the woods and we came upon a footprint. It was in the mud and well formed like a human print. Well I were a size 12 shoe and have since I was about 12 years old and I put my foot into the print and it was a good 4-6 inches longer than mine and a lot wider.Well I know what a bear print looks like as well as prints from the various animals in the area and the bear print was as close as I could come up with. But it had more human like toes not the long claws that you would see with a bear. Well we decided to get the heck out of the area. We then walked back out of the woods and back towards the cabin. Instead of walking the area of the woodline we took a path across the field. All of a suden my friend stopped and tried to speak, he almost turned pale white and he could not talk. He pointed into an area in the woods. I finally saw what he saw. Sitting on a old tree stump about 5 yards into the woods was what I believe to be a bigfoot. We were only 50 yards away from him and I could see clearly it sat there looking at us, and well it looked in another direction while we were starring at it and it was like he did not have a neck he moved his whole upper torso and then looked back at us. Well when he did this we took off running. I am now a police officer and have been for many years, and I still have never been as scarred as I was that very minute. When we got to the cabin we told my friends parents as well as my mom what we saw and what had happened. Well my friends dad got his pistol, and I got my dads 7mm. Deer rifle and we went back out, it was me my friends dad, and my friend. Well we went back into the wooded area and looked around for about an hour or so and found nothing. We then proceeded back out of the woods the same way we did when we saw this thing on the stump. Well I looked up towards my cabin and saw my mom she was waving her hands and yelling so I waved back. Well you have to know my mom she does not I repeat does not run for anything. Well she took off in a sprint towards us and when she got about about 100 yards from us she yelled that the creature was behind us.Well I turned and looked with my dads rifle reasy and I saw the back of the creature just for a second go into the woods. We then went back to the cabin and repported this to the local game and fish dept. They responded later that evening and we took the game warden to the area we were at. We could not find the print we had seen earlier, and I think he thought we were nuts. Well about he time we were coming back out we found a bush that had been layed float as if something had been sleepin there and it smelled. This was the only time I smelled anything. It smelled like real bad body odor mixed with urine and feces. Well we did not find anymore evidence. I have been back in the area many times. I do go out with a rifle but would not shoot this creature. I feel that if this creature was harmful towards me it could have killed me many times in the woods. We did have some people come from another state about a week later and ask if we were the ones who did the report and we told them no. I don't want a bunch of gun-toting idiots out there trying to hunt this thing.

I decided to write you the following report. About 8-10 years ago 6 (six) of us were hunting south of Indian Meadows trailhead. We were basically hunting across the rough and timbered area in pairs. Brad and I heard the noise in the distance. It sounded like a high pitched scream related to a rusty gate being opened slowly. There was wind and unsettled weather. It was in the afternoon! Later we learned that the others in our group also heard it, even closer to them. Steve and Miles had their wives with them as we combed the varying terrain searching for Elk. Everyone had highpowered hunting rifles. Steve and Germaine apparently got together with Miles and Cheri and decided to take the first main game trails out of the area. Steve was an avid bear hunter and was very disturbed about what he heard. Brad and I continued the hunt, really not getting the full impact of the sound effects. I heard the sound one other time in the same area. Miles and I were hunting elk with the bow and arrow and I had something come into my calling and never had the opportunity to see it close to the same area. No one had a visual on the animal. No tracks visible even at times when the snow was on the ground. We have all heard stories about creatures crossing the roadway early in the morning, other sightings and very rank smells in undergrowth areas. In relation to our hearing the vocalization, Miles spoke to me on the telephone on day about a television program about Big Foot and someone that had a recorded soundtrack of a believed big foot scream or call. Miles indicated that his wife came from her place of rest in the other room and stated, What was that noise? Miles replied to her, that was a recorded sound of a presumed big foot or Sasquatch. Cheri replied, \"That is the sound we heard hunting across from your Dad's house. Miles' dad's house is one of the last homes before you reach the wilderness boundary. The area you have documented near Stonewall Mountain is very close to this area. I hope this information supports believed big foot sightings in this area.

This private land operates as a summer camp during the summer and hosts small retreat groups during the fall, winter and spring months. I attended this summer camp for many years as a youth and then lived and worked there during the off-season as an adult. In addition, I have been camping at this very spot a dozen times within the past few years. In the summertime, the woods at night are alive with the sounds of nocturnal animals, crickets and frogs. During the winter months when all of the leaves have fallen off of the trees, the woods are dead silent at night. The only sounds you can hear are the wind and the occasional dog barking in the distance. So after we set up camp, we ate dinner and sat around the campfire for a while. We climbed into the tent and went to sleep around midnight. I drifted off to sleep and was awakened at about 2:30am by my nephew tossing and turning. He told me that he had indigestion from the dinner we ate and he asked if I had any antacids. He asked my friend too and we both indicated that we didn’t pack any. He then said that he needed to get up and walk it off. My nephew then proceeded to unzip the tent flap and go outside by the campfire. By then the fire had died out and I could hear him scratching around in the ashes looking for hot embers and cracking small sticks to build the fire again. Soon, I could see the light of the fire flickering against the side of the tent and hear the crackle and pop of burning wood. It was at this time that the most unusual sound pierced the silence. The sound came from the woods immediately surrounding our campsite and it could only be described as a loud yelp.  In all my years spent camping on this land, some in this very spot, I have never heard a sound like this one. The souund was very similar to the yelp recorded on your website except that it was slightly higher pitch and was much closer. There wasn't any echo. Immediately after hearing this sound my eyes shot open and my nephew who was still cracking sticks around the fire froze in silence. My mind was racing to think of what could have made this sound when I heard the tent flap quickly unzip, my nephew tumble inside and then quickly zip the flap back-up again. The three of us immediately whispered to each other and then lay silent. The next morning and every time we’ve been camping since we’ve always had a good laugh at my nephew’s expense. After listening to your sound recordings, I’m just in total shock at what it could have been.","classification":"Class B","county":"Stokes","state":"North Carolina","latitude":36.48615,"longitude":-80.375,"latlng":"-80.375,36.48615","locationDetails":"None.","dewPoint":59.06,"humidity":0.74,"cloudCover":0.5,"moonPhase":0.77,"pressure":1014.83,"weatherSummary":"Mostly cloudy until afternoon.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":9.12,"highTemp":79.54,"midTemp":70.095,"lowTemp":60.65,"precipitationIntensity":0.0089,"precipitationProbability":0.15,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":133,"windSpeed":1.31}

I was home for the weekend from college when my cousin Don and I decided to do a little squirrel hunting. Don had a 12-gauge shotgun and I had a 22-gauge rifle. I had seen a fair amount of squirrel activity around while fishing at a nearby farm pond and thought we would make this a fruitful trip. This is rural America with the nearest town of 1,000 just 15 miles away. It is also a farming community with large fields dotting the countryside and woods separating the fields. The area we planed to hunt is made up of mostly hardwood trees with cypress trees down near the river that flowed through the property. We walked about a half mile into the woods until we came over a ridge and started down towards the river which was about 75 yards away, all the while looking up in the treetops for squirrel sign.  I look down to insure my footing when I caught a glimpse of something off to my right between me and the river. Coming up from the river bottom was a huge dark mass. I froze in my tracks and my cousin bumped into the back of me. I could feel the barrel of the 12 gauge across the small of my back. Don looked around me and said, “what is that?” I couldn’t speak.  The mass continued in our direction taking long strides and ignoring the small trees, brush, and briars in its path, as if they were not there. It stopped about 30 feet from us. It looked upset that we happen to intrude in its space. I could clearly see its face, body, feet and hands. It had dark brown hair that was longer on its head and arms than the legs, chest and stomach.  Very short hair on its face, and the skin shone through.  The hair was darker the closer to the body it was. It looked to be about 9 to 10 feet tall with a very heavy muscular structure and weighing about 800 lbs. I am 6’1” and was about 4 feet higher up the ridge yet could almost look eye to eye with the creature. It then grabbed a dead old hardwood tree still upright which was about 6 inches in diameter in its right hand with its left hand placed on a larger oak about 20 inches in diameter. As it looked at us with yellowish looking bloodshot eyes, it snapped the old dead oak off at the ground and made a loud grunting bark. I could see it’s teeth with the canines a little longer than our own but not pronounced like a bear or dogs. I could even see vapor from its breath. I don’t think it could see mine because I was not breathing.  I didn’t smell anything and didn’t expect to, as it was downwind. I could feel the 12-gauge’s barrel getting pushed further into the small of my back as cousin Don was positioning himself with me directly between him and the creature. It seemed aggressive at first, but it did not get any closer than 30 feet. Like it wanted to send a message, which my cousin and I read loud and clear. We were not invited, so get the heck out of there! I was now ready for a hasty retreat as my legs started to finally move and the brain cramp I experienced seemed to lessen. As I turned around to leave, Don and I kind of got crossed up. We scrambled back over the ridge and ran for at least a quarter mile before we stopped. Don was hysterical. For a guy with a back as wide as a house, the screaming and tears just did not fit. I was trying to calm him down, at the same time trying to understand what we had seen.  As we both calmed down, and weak legged from just running the 440 along with the loss of adrenaline, we kind of just fell on our backsides. After a few choice words between two teenagers, we came to the conclusion that it probably was just a bootlegger in a gorilla suit.  That was just a show to mind us to stay away from some hidden moonshine still.  Why we didn’t shoot it was also discussed and we both agreed that it didn’t seem right. We are experienced hunters and you just don’t shoot to be shooting, and as far as we knew this think was not in season. It also looked too human.  I looked into the Bigfoot phenomena by purchasing the book “Bigfoot” by Ann Slate and Alan Berry. The accounts described by Alan gave me solace that I was not alone. Others were experiencing the same encounters. My conclusion still shifted back to the moonshiner theory, even as I felt the gorilla costume seemed to fit the moonshiner too well. So that’s the story we told our relatives. Even though it never seemed right or fit the experience, that’s the way I saw it. I left the area to go back to college after that. Never really returning. My brother built a house not 300 yards from where we had the encounter, and I plan to visit the spot from time to time. I guess in one way to hope for a chance encounter and in another way to relive the one I had. Man what a rush. After the demise of Ray Wallace, I felt I should tell this story now. Also in hope that others in rural eastern North Carolina that may have experienced a similar story might want to tell theirs.","classification":"Class A","county":"Sampson","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.18637,"longitude":-78.63611,"latlng":"-78.63611,35.18637","locationDetails":"[Omitted at witness' request]","dewPoint":37.14,"humidity":0.94,"cloudCover":0.99,"moonPhase":0.78,"pressure":1015.58,"weatherSummary":"Rain until afternoon.","uvIndex":2,"visibility":2.82,"highTemp":41.03,"midTemp":37.575,"lowTemp":34.12,"precipitationIntensity":0.0233,"precipitationProbability":1,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":14,"windSpeed":6.63}

At approximately 12:30am I was driving south on I95 near exit 2 or 3 just a few miles from the South Carolina border with a tractor trailer approximately 400-500 yards in front of me. I had been following this truck for awhile when it looked like something had either been hit by the truck, kicked up or maybe a deer crossed behind the truck. In quick order, first the right taillight then the reflective material in the middle then the left tail light went dark and came back on. Instantly I cancelled the cruise control, steered my vehicle to straddle the center line thinking I would either have to avoid some debris in the road or avoid a deer that could be standing in the road and leaned towards the windshield to get a better look. As I approached the spot where this happened there was nothing in the road, but standing on the median side of the road was for lack of better understanding a Bigfoot! It was hairy from head to toe and huge. At least 7' tall. As I got closer it took two huge steps and went down the side of the embankment into the median. I was literally no more then 10-15' away from it when passing it. I was able to hit the high beams as it took the second step. This entire scenario played out in probably 10 seconds or so. I can not come up with a reasonable explanation for what I saw. It was not a man, no clothing and hairy plus the stride length was insane. I'm 6' 4\" and no way I could have a stride that long. It was not a bear, it was standing on two legs and had arms and hands. This thing was nearly impossible to see even with the head lights on high beam it was so black. The only reasonable explanation I could come up with it was some nut job in a ghillie suit playing frogger. However the two steps it took were much longer then any man could make.","classification":"Class A","county":"Robeson","state":"North Carolina","latitude":34.5287,"longitude":-79.26708,"latlng":"-79.26708,34.5287","locationDetails":"I'm not sure if it was just prior to exit 3 or 2.

It was about 3:00am in the morning, when I awoke to a 'howling', or 'wailing' sound  just outside the house, coming from the direction of the woods. This lasted for probably 30 seconds to a minute. My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound. I was frightened, so I did not get up to investigate. It took my at least an hour to fall back asleep. I never associated this sound with 'bigfoot', until now. I downloaded the \"Howl.wav\" (http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm) file from your web site. It has a eerie howling sound, with dogs obviously reacting to the noise. I had chills when I heard this, because it was very similar, if not identical to the sound I had heard that early morning. I have played it over and over again. I am a hunter and outdoors man, and I had never heard an animal make this sound before. It was definitely 'organic' in origin. I never thought about Bigfoot living in this part of the state, because the surrounding areas are somewhat populated. There are, however, lots of rural swamp lands and forest areas. Although I have no further evidence to back up my claims, I thought this would be worthy to report. I'd be interested to know if Bigfoot really could exist in a coastal woodlands area, rather than the mountainous regions that the creature is normally associated with.","classification":"Class B","county":"Pender","state":"North Carolina","latitude":34.3924,"longitude":-77.7485,"latlng":"-77.7485,34.3924","locationDetails":"Near Hampstead, Pender County, North Carolina.

It happened about 1982, I was about 17 at the time of the sighting. It was in the fall, around October. First of all I should start by letting you Know I am what you would call a city boy. Scared and out of place in the woods. A friend of mine invited me to go Deer hunting with his father and him on a large parcel of private property they owned in North Carolina. I'm willing to try  anything, so I went. This Property was set back away from the closest road about a 1/2 mile on foot, before you even got to the cabins they owned. These cabins were on stilts, like a beach house about 10 foot high, with stairs. For what reason I have no idea although we were next to a small inland waterway. At about 5am in the morning we proceeded to go hunting, my friends taking me to my deer stand and moving on to thiers. This deer stand was about 10 feet high in a tree. I did see many deer and a black bear that day, but I didn't have the heart to shoot them. I guess at about 9 am My sighting began with a bad smell. It smelled worse than a dog that had been playing in a sewer.  Then I heard it before I saw it, snapping twigs as it walked, at first I thought it was my friend and his dad, come to rescue me from this ordeal. I only saw it from the waist up, from a distance of about 50 yards. And if It knew I was there, It didn't care. It stood in one spot for a good 5 minutes eating leaves, so I got a good look at it. Having seen a bear earlier that day there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY this could be a case of mistaken identity. This creature had hands like a human, that plucked the leaves it was eating and it looked very fussy about the ones it wanted. They looked dark black in color and relatively hairless except the back of the hand was hairy. It looked to be about 8 foot tall, and just unbelievably massive in the chest and shoulder areas. Its fur was very dark black in color. I only caught a glimpses of its face, as its back was to me, and it looked hairy except around the eyes. The neck was short and stubby with a kind of furry ridge that ran up the back of the neck, to the top of what looked like a slightly pointed head, that sloped down to the  forehead, like a gorilla I saw in the DC zoo. When I lost sight of it I could still hear it crunch sticks and leaves ,as it walked on its way for about 5 more minutes. Needless to say I was so scared I almost Peed myself waiting quietly for my friends to come save me. When they arrived, I told them the story, and of coarse they thought it was a bear.

{"id":"1939","timestamp":-134179200,"title":"Youth's presence startles unknown animal","observed":"I experienced this incident while living on a military base in North Carolina.  I was approximately 14 or 15 years old at the time, I am fifty now, however the incident is still fresh in my mind.  At that time there was nothing for a young boy to do so my favorite pastime was wandering the military reservation and search for discarded C rations as we never had enough to eat in the house.There was 8 people in my family.  One day I had skipped school to go C ration hunting.  I never will forget that day, it was very warm and sunny, which for North Carolina is not unusual for a fall day.  We used to call it indian summer.  I had been wandering the deeper recesses of the reservation and was quite proud of the fact that not only had I stumbled across old farmsteads that the Marine corps had condemed in order to take the land but had a pretty good supply of discarded C rations.  Realizing it was getting late and I had better get home, I hit a tank trail made by the marines for thier vehicles to use.  I was getting closer to home so I decided to leave the trail and short cut it through the woods.  I knew this particular area and always avoided it because it was known as a pocosin, which in local terms meant an area that is real dense and swampy.  As I made my way in to the pocosin something really seemed out of the ordinary, all day I was used to hearing the sounds of the forest, birds, frogs squirrels chattering and what was great not seeing another human being. Now it was so quiet it didn't seem natural.  Something made me stop and to this very day I am perplexed about this I don't know why because at that age you have no fear as you think you are going to live forever.  I had no fear this time either however I felt that I was being watched.  I have never had this feeling again.  I slowly started to turn my head to the right when I caught a glimpse of brown.  My first thought was oh its only a deer.  I stood stock still and kept looking at the brown patch and it didnt move.  It was in a VERY dense part of the pocosin and my second thought was maybe its not a deer but possibly a discarded marine corps field jacket.  Now that would be a treasure, as I started to go towards the object I seem to hear the crashing of brush first then that brown patch moved, only it moved higher.  I  estimate a height of between 8 and 10 feet.  As it grew in height it also grew broader exposing more of itself.  I never saw its head or any real features other than the long fur because that thing was moving so fast through that pocosin that I was amazed how any animal that size could do that.  The crashing of the branches and underbrush was loud and I all I could do was stand there.  I don't know how long I remained in that position, all I rememeber is the sounds of the forest returned and thats what snapped me back to the present.  I have only recalled this story once and was told never again to repeat it to anyone or go back in those woods.  I have never returned to that area.","classification":"Class A","county":"Onslow","state":"North Carolina","latitude":34.6894,"longitude":-77.2914,"latlng":"-77.2914,34.6894","locationDetails":"On the military reservation Camp Lejuene marine corps base approximately 5 miles from Highway 24 in Hubert, North Carolina.","dewPoint":68.96,"humidity":0.79,"cloudCover":0.89,"moonPhase":0.22,"pressure":1016.43,"weatherSummary":"Humid and mostly cloudy throughout the day.","uvIndex":3,"visibility":6.03,"highTemp":79.34,"midTemp":75.32,"lowTemp":71.3,"windBearing":200,"windSpeed":9.18}

I was traveling with my mom and younger brother in a car on a rural road near Rocky Mount, N.C. in 1979. It was at night. We spotted a tall hairy figure crossing the road ahead of us. It was close enough to see in the headlights. (I am remembering all of this through a child's eyes but my mom remembers the same accounts). We slowed down, almost to a complete stop because the figure stopped right in the middle of the road. It turned and looked at us with it's body still facing in the direction it was originally headed. It was extremely tall, had hair all over it's body and it's arms were really long. It suddenly ran with super fast speed and jumped the ditch and was gone. It was like nother I had ever seen before or have seen since. I have been an avid outdoorsman...I hunt and fish and camp all over NC, SC & VA. I have seen bears in their natural invironments. I have seen them stand to look at me and then run away, but they always go back down to all fours to do that. I am convinced that what I saw as a child was in fact, a Bigfoot or sasquatch. Not only that, but a cousin of mine was driving near the same area in which we saw the Bigfoot about ten years ago. Which would be about twenty years after our sighting. I had never told him of our encounter. He was driving alone and at night and had almost the same sighting that we had had years earlier.

{"id":"450","timestamp":968457600,"title":"Possible vocalizations heard by campers on the Blueridge Parkway","observed":"My wife, children, my father, our lab mix dog and I were camping At Bear Den Campground Sept 7th thru the 11th, 2000.  The campground is located just off the Blue ridge parkway near SprucePine, NC. I have summited a report earlier this year my grandfather told me about (local legend stuff). Anyway, The first night there I could not sleep and was reading a book, it was around 2-3am.  I turned off the lantern and was just getting settled in when I heard a howl/moan. It sounded sort of like a cow bellowing only alot deeper.  The sound was off to the southwest of the campsite and sounded maybe 1 mile away.  It was very quiet that night and I could hear away in the distance a train coming through the valley. This sound would call out (oooooohhhh, ooooooohhh, oooooooohhh) like it was lost or searching for something. I sat up and listened to it for more than 30 mins. I looked over at my dog but he was just asleep.  It moved away over the ridge the the west. I thought at first maybe it was a cow and a layed back down to go to sleep.  I woke up around 4 am hearing it again this time coming back over the ridge and going more back to the south east.  I told my wife about the next day, she did not believe me.  My father arrived at the camp on the 9th. The morning of the 10th my dad asked me if I was up the previous night. I told him no, I went bed around 11pm and sleep all night till 7am.  He said he heard what he thought was a bird at first in the trees directly behind my tent around 3am.  He said it made a Whoop, Whoop, Whoop noise and lasted for several mins and was very loud.  He got up with his flashlight and checked around but didnt see anything.  He described the noise as something up in the trees.  The trees at the camp site where mostly pine with a few large oaks.  We didnt check around for anything then because he was sure it was just a bird or something.  The same thing happened on the morning of the 11th.  He stated to me that \"that thing was back again a 3 o'clock in the morning\".  He described to me the same whoop, whoop, whoop sound and that it ended very low in a chattering kind of sound you hear at the zoo, like a monkey.  My wife heard my dad and said she had heard it both nights.  I slept through the whole thing. I sort of felt that maybe it could have been a bigfoot but both my wife and dad described it as being up in the trees behind the tent. Also my dog did not wake up at any of the noises.  This dog can't stand any kind of wildlife and will bark at it till it leaves. Only around people does he \"lounge around\".  I kept asking my wife and dad to give me more details such as smells.  Neither smelt anything or heard any other noises.  I figured that it had to be just some animal or maybe a peacock because it did not come across as any of the other vocalizations encounters I have heard about before. About a week after we got back My dad, stepmom, wife and I were at my home and the conversation went back to those sounds.  Both my wife and dad said \"It sounded like something a the zoo\" again and I remembered that this site has vocalizations recorded.  I played the howl and scream.  The howl is close to what I heard only much longer, lower in pitch and slower. When I played the scream both my dad and wife \"went white\". My dad jumped up and said \"that's it!, that's what I heard only there was like a chattering at the end\". My wife refused to discuss it any further and acted both scared and mad. Please note I have 3 kids ages 3- 10 years old and they nor my dog heard or seemed to hear anything. I hesitated about posting this report until I read the most recent postings about the vocalizations, especially the sightings of a bigfoot up in a tree. I have never heard that these things could climb before. Also how my dog did not react to any of the sounds, I noticed in another report how some dogs will react and in one case the dog did not at a sighting.","classification":"Class B","county":"Mitchell","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.8934,"longitude":-81.98335,"latlng":"-81.98335,35.8934","locationDetails":"BearDen Campground Rt 3 Box 284 SprucePine, NC 28777 Just off the BlueRidge parkway milepost 324.8","dewPoint":64.35,"humidity":0.79,"cloudCover":0.3,"moonPhase":0.37,"pressure":1019.37,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy until afternoon.","uvIndex":7,"visibility":8.29,"highTemp":81.16,"midTemp":71.915,"lowTemp":62.67,"windBearing":88,"windSpeed":1.55}
{"id":"24988","observed":"Before describing the incident I thought I should give you some personal background. After my family had a suspected nighttime visit from a juvenile sasquatch about a dozen years ago, I’ve developed a keen interest in the subject and have read hundreds of sighting reports in the BFRO site. By learning what to listen for and following up leads, I have identified my own research site in the northeastern US where I have had a string of auditory encounters/interactions that have included woodknocks, screams, stalking, and a possible infrasound experience. I’ve located a number of stick structures on my site. I’ve joined my state BF association for which I have investigated an alleged Class B sighting. I have also hiked other areas of my state in the company of others more experienced than I, and have observed tracks and learned where to look for them. I should tell you that when I have had the experiences described above, such as a scream directed at me in the dark from 40 yards away, or a single baseball bat, hollow sounding “thwok” on a tree just over a slight rise in the terrain at a similar distance, or the stalking foot steps perhaps 50 feet away, my first reaction is to go into denial, with my mind first racing through various possible alternative scenarios to explain the sound. After that, once I have realized that the other scenarios are unlikely explanations, I have a natural tendency to dissociate from the fear reaction, I remain calm, avoid looking in the direction of the sound, and simply move away from the area at a deliberate, but unhurried pace, to avoid showing fear. Often, the fear kicks-in hours or days later. I have never felt threatened during an incident.  I was very excited when I was invited to visit an elderly friend who lives in the mountains of western North Carolina, as I knew there were some notable sightings in the general area as well as a BFRO expedition. I arrived after dark on a Tuesday and discovered that my friend’s summer home is located at the top of a mountain. Her “development” consists of about 60 homes tucked away in the woods on steep slopes accessed via a series of narrow gravel and macadam roads. My first thought was – they built this development in a likely squatch habitat. Apparently an effort was made to keep the environment natural and retain most of the trees. It really was like staying in a tree house. At night time, it was possible to see only the two neighboring homes, one located 50 feet from my friend’s house and the other perhaps 50 yards away. Her house has large picture windows, front and back, through which the occupants could easily be observed at night. Indeed, as we sat watching TV after dinner, I began to have the creepy sensation of being watched, although my friend told me that neither of her neighbors was in residence that night. After the news, about 11:30, I told my friend I was stepping outside from some night air, when in fact my intention was to have a look around and listen to the woods. I took up a position in the shadows on a flagstone walk which spans the front of her house, standing beneath the low overhang of the roof. The area in which I was standing was not well lighted, but I observed that my friend had spot lights facing away from her home on both sides, lighting the space between the homes and partially illuminating the road in front of her house. The front of the house faces up the slope and the house itself sits below the road level. In between, on a slighting higher “terrace” is a curved gravel driveway in which our two cars sat. I peered around the side of the house and noticed the house was on a very steep slope. The front of the house was tucked into the mountainside, but in the back half, the foundation was exposed and the deck jutted out over the slope, supported by several wooden “legs.” I wasn’t outdoors more than five minutes before I was startled by what sounded like answering wood knocks: a single thump that came from the woods at the one o’clock position, followed by another “answering” thump  5-10 seconds later, coming from about three o’clock. The sounds were repeated every couple of minutes for perhaps 15 minutes and it sounded as if the second knock was changing positions slightly. I estimate that they were a couple of hundred yards away from my position. Noticing a wood pile next to my friend’s house, I picked up a thick log and added a third knock by whacking a nearby tree. I noticed that the first knock came again quickly, almost in answer to mine. After few repetitions, the knocks stopped. There was a slight breeze that evening that gusted through the trees from time to time. On one such occasion, I heard what sounded like a small stone hitting the roof that overhung my position. I told myself it was a probably a  tree branch falling on the roof, but when it happened a second time perhaps 15 minutes later during another gust, my eye caught the trajectory of a small stone whizzing overhead from the brush on the other side of the cars and bouncing off the roof above me. Then from the corner of my eye, I caught a flash of something gray moving to my side of the road. I told myself it was my imagination. The wood thumps resumed. This time, I did not feel secure in leaving the shelter of my position, so I did answering stomps on the flag stone. The knocks kept coming but the intervals between them were longer. After about an hour of being outdoors, I decided to go inside. I noticed that my friend kept the lights on all night. Next morning, when I asked her about the lights being on, she said that since her husband passed away about two years before, she worries about someone breaking into the house. There had been some break-ins during the winter one year at the home of a neighbor, which unnerved my friend, even though the perpetrator had been apprehended in the midst of a break-in. I asked about the wildlife of the area and was told that there were plenty of deer and occasional bears were in the neighborhood. Late in the afternoon of the next day, I went for out for exercise, running the steep looping roads around the development. As I set out, I observed that the woods across from the front of the house where I’d been standing on the previous night, had some of the most dense brush I have even seen. As I ran downhill through one of the undeveloped areas, one with a road and a no houses as yet, I had that sense of being observed. I paused at an intersection where two roads intersect with a trailhead, noting that the well-maintained trail on the left side of the road seemed to become a game trail on the other side; however, to reach the game trail from the road, you would have to scale a steep 12-feet high bank after crossing a shallow drainage culvert. Yet the game trail seemed to be frequented by larger animals. Inspecting the bank, I found what appeared to be the impressions of the front three-quarters of two, human-like foot prints jammed into the soft dirt of the bank. I could feel the impressions left by the toes. That night after TV, I again went outside and smoked a cigar this time. I heard the thumps again coming from the same general direction, that is, northeast and uphill from my position. I heard a plaintive, eerie howling coming from the south, behind the house. It sounded every 30 seconds of so for perhaps 20 minutes. I told myself it could be a dog tied outdoors. I decided not to interact that night. I just had a feeling that it was not the thing to do. Finishing my cigar, I went indoors, read a book and turned off the light. I do not know how long I had been asleep before I was startled awake by what sounded like heavy foot thumping on the roof, which was separated from the ceiling of my room by a narrow crawl space. As I sat up in my bed, I heard another couple of thumps that sounded as if they came from the area over the closet. In my sleepy state, I reasoned that perhaps my friend in the adjoining room had bumped the wall in her sleep. Soon I was fast asleep again, only to be scared awake by what was clearly pounding on the walls of my room that was so loud, my first thought was, “Someone is breaking into my room!”  I sat up in bed and threw on the overhead light in my room. Now I remembering thinking, “This has to be a visit from bigfoot” because of the loudness of the sound and the fact that the walls of my room are fairly high above grade, due to the steep slope. I was in a bit of denial about this and was exhausted from the day’s workout on mountain roads at higher than normal altitude for me (almost 4000” above sea level;) although I tried to stare out the window to see if a form appeared,  I quickly fell back to sleep. Then I was awakened again by what sound like hands being slapped on the roof or walls, more lightly this time, and moving in a away from my position down the slope. I did not feel threatened and had a feeling that the maker of the sound was leaving for the night, I had that distinct impression. I heard nothing more. Next morning over breakfast, my hostess asked me if I had been awakened by that that “awful pounding” on the roof. We traded our stories. My friend told me that nothing of the sort had happened before in the 25 years she and her husband had lived in the house. She had had raccoons in the attic of her Florida home, which required the services of a pest control company, but she maintained that she had never heard anything so loud. She was concerned and asked me what I thought it might have been; I pleaded ignorance, and said I would confer with the neighbors, a couple in their late 50s who had arrived the previous night for a stay of a few days. The husband dismissed the noise, saying that it might have been made by critters moving indoors away from the cold. However, I was later told that he checked the crawl space and found no evidence of an animal infestation or occupancy. Before leaving my friend to continue on my trip towards eastern NC, I inspected the area around her house for footprints. I found none, but I discovered that a tall tree grew up through the back deck through a hole that had been cut for it. The tree would provide easy access to the deck and roof, while the low roof in front would make the roof accessible from that position.","classification":"Class B","county":"Mcdowell","state":"North Carolina","locationDetails":"Do not post location on line other than to say “near Blue Ridge parkway”.

We were all sitting around it talking.  It rained all day so the night seemed darker than usual.  The house is set on thirty wooded acres with a creek about twenty-five feet away.  There aren't many houses on this mountain due to the fact that it runs with the Pisgah National Forest. I went in the house to get the cd player.  It was a very still night.  We listened to a few songs; when we decided to play the Sierra Sounds cd with bigfoot recordings on it.  As we listened to the cd we all became jumpy and the feeling of someone was watching us came over us.  We then started hearing sounds of what sounded like saplings being broken up above us; higher up in the mountain.  We just laughed it all off as nerves.  Then we heard what sounded like a tree about ten inches around being broke then slide down the mountain at us.  All us became scared and ran to the porch of the house for protection.  When I seen my cousin run I knew it had to be something.  He is in his late thirties and has grown up in the mountains.  He is familiar with the animals sounds and the layout of the mountain.  I don't know if it was anything or not, but it sure scared the heck out of us.","classification":"Class A","county":"Madison","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.892,"longitude":-82.829,"latlng":"-82.829,35.892","locationDetails":"Edited out per request of witness and family.","dewPoint":68.11,"humidity":0.79,"cloudCover":0.54,"moonPhase":0.97,"pressure":1016.83,"weatherSummary":"Light rain in the afternoon.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":6.57,"highTemp":83.57,"midTemp":75.75,"lowTemp":67.93,"precipitationIntensity":0.0146,"precipitationProbability":0.76,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":238,"windSpeed":4.57}

My friend was a skeptical before that but he was a little stifled by the sounds we heard that night.

{"id":"50074","timestamp":1445731200,"title":"Possible encounter scares a camper from his hammock while in the Uwharrie National Forest","observed":"To begin, I am 34 years old, I have a degree in Biology, and I have spent my entire life in the woods mostly by myself and have grown accustomed to the noises animals and the forest itself makes. I go backpacking and backcountry camping year round. I am not an expert but I have experience in the woods. My wife, two dogs, and I were camping in Uwharrie National on October 23 -25. Friday night we heard a lot of noises ranging from coyotes far away to leaves rustling just outside our site. I just purchased a hammock and wanted to try it out in the woods. So Saturday I set up my hammock 20-30 feet into the woods just outside our site. Our site is on the side and near the entrance of the campground and the most secluded with the woods to its back; this is why we choose it. So I go to bed in the hammock Saturday night facing the campground and the woods behind me, and all is well until 2:30am, I wake up to branches breaking behind my head. The branches sounded like they could have been as close as 30 feet to as far away as 50 feet to my right. Imagine if my head is 12 o’clock and my feet are 6 o’clock, these branches were being broken at 11-12 o’clock or over my right shoulder. At first I thought it was a deer or a bear passing by but I know what they sound like as they walk (a couple months ago I was face to face with a mother bear and her cubs), but I never actually heard distinct footsteps and as the breaking didn’t move in location I became a little freaked out. I’m lying in the hammock trying to explain what is going on and nothing is making sense. I never made a noise to scare it away and didn’t shine my headlamp. Then I hear a noise that is hard to explain come from about 1 o’clock or over my left shoulder. I can only describe this as similar to the noise a deer makes when it’s alerting other deer to danger, but if a deer were to make this noise it would have to be 20 feet tall. It was deeper than any noise I’ve ever heard come from the forest. Deeper than a lion’s roar and as long as a human’s sigh. The branch breaking continued for about 15 minutes until I start hearing the alternating branch break and what sounded like a large bird flapping its wings one time. I heard ‘snap whoosh, snap whoosh, snap whoosh’. About this time, I hear my wife coughing and before we went to bed she said that her stomach was feeling a little upset, I thought maybe she is sick. I muster up the courage to get out of the hammock hoping that in doing so I will also scare away the animal. I go up to her and she’s fine, now I have a dilemma, I don’t want to go back but I can’t stay in the tent because my sleeping bag is in the woods. So I go back and I pick up a branch, snap it and throw it in to the woods three times. Then I urinate all around my hammock. While I was doing this the branch breaking had ceased. I get in the hammock and seconds after turning off my headlamp the breaking begins again. I listen, while getting more and more scared, to the breaking for a couple more minutes. I shine my light into the woods and the breaking stops, I turn off the light and it starts back. I waited a couple more minutes and turned my light on again and the breaking stops, I turn the light off and it starts back. I’m lying in the hammock completely terrified at this point and decide the only thing I should do is retreat to the tent with my wife and dogs. It was like torture to be in the hammock. So I quickly grab my sleeping bag, walk to the tent, get in, and lay down. We both heard the branches being broken for about 15 more minutes, then we heard one large break that sounded like a 4 inch log being broken in half that echoed through the woods. It was almost as if they were saying ‘And stay out’. I was so terrified and my adrenaline was pumping so much that I couldn’t sleep for about an hour. The next day my wife and I look around the area for any sign of foot print or the branches themselves. I didn’t find any sign of activity. We did find a grassy area with three large rock piles. Two of the piles were old and had trees growing out of the pile, one was newer with nothing but small vegetation growing on top. One thing to keep in mind is that the area is frequented by campers so there are few branches, especially large ones, on the ground for anything to step on; and there are paths all through the area and as we all know animals will always take the easiest route when traveling. Something else we thought of is Saturday we both went to the bathroom deep in the woods, we thought \"what if we encroached in their land?\". Before I was skeptical but now I know there is something out there and this experience has truly changed my life.","classification":"Class B","county":"Montgomery","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.46955,"longitude":-80.08778,"latlng":"-80.08778,35.46955","locationDetails":"Uwharrie National Forest","dewPoint":58.12,"humidity":0.82,"cloudCover":0.07,"moonPhase":0.43,"pressure":1021.41,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy overnight.","uvIndex":4,"visibility":9.85,"highTemp":74.71,"midTemp":66.01,"lowTemp":57.31,"windBearing":251,"windSpeed":1.05}

I heard a lot of moving about on the other side of a nearly dry creek bed around 8:00 pm.  The movement was a large animal by the sound of the larger branches breaking.  The animal came across the creek near a spot we had been using as our latrine.  I turned on my headlamp and yelled out \"go on\" thinking bear or something.  The movement stopped but then started closer to the camp so I yelled out again.  Then I got a bit scared when two rocks were smashed together \"bang, bang (pause) then bang bang\" again. This freaked me out a bit so I yelled again.  Then above me on the hillside I heard something being thrown through the woods and landing further down the small valley we were in.  Then the day birds started chirping in an arc across the hill side.  Not long after an owl started hooting quite far away.  Dogs started barking all over the forest and the owl stopped.  Then I heard a wail deeper in the woods and it seemed like after the wail the woods went back to normal.  I have spent a lot of time in the woods but this chain of events that went on from 8:00pm to around 12:00 am has unnerved me a bit.

Neither my wife nor I had ever been to Wilmington, NC before so one Saturday we made a day trip to Wilmington.  We saw some sites, did some shopping, had dinner and went to a late movie. While driving back to Camp Lejuene on US-17, just north of the town of Holly Ridge I noticed a very large figure on the right shoulder ahead.  It was walking upright and I assumed it was a bear. I slowed down in order to avoid hitting it should it go down on all four legs and flee.  I was going perhaps 10 MPH or a bit less when I finally realized that what I was approaching was not a bear.  The creature I saw was massive; maybe 7 to 8 feet tall and I'd estimate 600 Lbs or more.  The hair was a lighter brownish color and appeared long in its length.  I could see its face very clearly. What struck me at the time and even to this day is that the creature appeared to be oblivious to his surroundings and seemed deep in thought.  It never gave any indication that he was aware of the car approaching nor did the bright headlights seem to cause it discomfort.  It just kept moving along at a slow pace looking straight ahead.  I finally passed the creature at nearly walking speed.  I assumed I had to have been mistaken or could not have seen what I thought I had so I stopped the car.  I looked back out the rear window and could see the creature still walking southbound in the glow of the stop lamps of the car. I woke up my wife and had her look.  She did look but said it must have been a bear.  At that point I let it go and resumed my northbound trip back to Jacksonville. One other thing to note is that my impression was that the creature was clean in the sense that its hair was not matted nor in tuffs.  The hair was straight and laid flat against its body and seemed to vary in length from a couple inches to maybe 5 inches.  There was no hair on the face which was a bit lighter in complexion than the fur surrounding it.","classification":"Class A","county":"Onslow","state":"North Carolina","latitude":34.50917,"longitude":-77.53445,"latlng":"-77.53445,34.50917","locationDetails":"East side shoulder of US-17 approximately one or two miles north of the town of Holly Ridge, NC","dewPoint":59.71,"humidity":0.71,"cloudCover":0.21,"moonPhase":0.86,"pressure":1019.21,"weatherSummary":"Partly cloudy in the morning.","uvIndex":5,"visibility":6.5,"highTemp":83.04,"midTemp":70.665,"lowTemp":58.29,"windBearing":258,"windSpeed":4.04}

I was at the trailhead of Dutchmans Creek at 9 in the morning during a week day about two weeks ago. Mine was the only car at the trailhead until after 10:30 with only logging trucks passing through every 30-45 minutes. I was walking down Dutchmans Creek, enjoying the solitude and quiet of the forest when I turned a bend and heard a loud wood knock at my two o'clock and was answered by another at my 10  o'clock within one second of the first. It threw me off because it sounded like an answering reply. I walked back up the trail and hung out for about thirty minutes just listening relaxing before I choose to head back down the trail. As i approached the same bend in the trail I again heard a wood knock at my 10 o'clock and then a second at my 5 o'clock. Extremely weird I thought, and again within one second of each other. I decided to walk back up the trail towards the second knock. There's an atv trail near the trailhead I walked up until I heard another wood knock around the same area I would have estimated the second at my 5 o'clock would have been. I waited for about fifteen minutes without hearing or seeing anything else. I decided to walk back to the base of the trail head and within twenty foot steps back down the trail I heard something huff at me from over my left shoulder. It came from inside a deep ditch but I didn't see anything there. I've had deer huff at me before when I've gotten close and they spotted me, I'm sure bear huff as well to threaten/challenge something but what got me was that I heard and saw no movement at all throughout this entire time. I walked back to the trailhead, waited 15-20 min and then snook back towards the same spot. I was completely quiet; no rustling from my clothes, boots didn't rustle plants and no crunch from dried leaves or twigs. As I approached I heard what sounded like a guttural baby moan or call. This occurred in high brush on the other side of the ditch to my right. The sound occurred every hand full of minutes and I would creep closer to see if I could spot it. Though the sound would change the direction it was facing there was never any movement in the brush and though I always carry when I'm in the woods I dared not enter into the thick brush, especially since I couldn't identify the animal that had huffed at me nor what type of animal was making the cries from in the brush. I didn't feel spooked until after the event when I thought over what had happened. I enjoy the woods, tracking and following game trails and though most of my experience is in Florida swamps with hogs or deer I couldn't identify the guttural moaning or see the thing that huffed at me.","classification":"Class B","county":"Montgomery","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.31331,"longitude":-80.00272,"latlng":"-80.00272,35.31331","locationDetails":"Woodrun Dutchmans creek trailhead, sparsely used atv trail conjoined there.

I was heading toward the beach in my sports car, top down music blasting.  It was around 8:45 pm so it was still light, sort of dusk dark.  I had my headlights on cruising about 60 mph  when I rounded a corner and there in the road stood this large hairy thing.   I slammed on brakes and swerved around it, but I must have glanced it because it bounced over the passenger side of my car.   I slid the car around and stopped where my headlights were about halfway on the thing.   It got up and came at me.  I was about 25 feet away from the thing and the smell was horrible. It hung in the air like a wet blanket.   It was about 7 to 7.5 feet high, reddishbrown matted looking hair,  its face was hairless and he looked ticked.   I put the car in reverse, backed up and threw the car in drive and took off.  As I was spinning around I looked in the rearview mirror and it was right on my cars rear end.  I heard a loud bang. About that time my car caught traction and took off.  I left the creature running down the road after me.  I have never been so scared in all my life.  After I got to my destination I checked my car.  The passenger rear quarter panel  was dented in with hair on it.  And my rear spoiler was shattered where he had hit the rear of my car.    I told my friends, family, police and insurance that I had hit a stray cow.  But it took weeks to get that smell off of the outside of my car and the inside still had that smell.   It was a under smell, like sewage and something else.  I was 27 then, I'm 38 now.  I have not been down that road since.

I live in Carteret county and at the time worked in Sneads Ferry (Onslow County) and the commute to work everyday took me through camp LeJeune via the back gate. As I made the turn onto Hwy. 17 off of Hwy. 172 I noticed what I thought was a bear sitting  down under a huge pecan tree on the right. Since there was about 50 or 60 feet distance between me & \"the bear\" I decided to pull of to the side of the road & watch him for a minute. It was a warm July morning & I had the windows of my truck rolled down as usual and noticed the most ungodly smell I had ever experienced. It was kinda like rotten eggs mixed with sewage & sulfur. As I sat & watched I quickly realized that this was no bear as the creature stood up from the croutched position walked over to the pecan tree & began shaking it. I was floored by what I was watching. Understand that this tree is immense & the creature had no problem shaking the pecans from it. Pecans that are still in the green hulls by the way. I wanted a better look at it since the whole sighting was with it's back to me so I put the truck in 1st gear (ready to bug out if need be)  & blowed the horn. It suddenly stopped & just completely froze still with it's back to me. it stayed like that til I layed down on the horn about 10 seconds later & it slowly turned & looked right at me. Thats when my heart decided to do the 50 yard dash in 2.3 seconds. I couldn't see it's face that well but it stood about 8 - 10 ft. Tall & it's hair was very long & matty. It stared at me for what seemed an eternity & made a loud screaching noise & tore off into the woods. The sprint from the tree to the woods was about 30 yards or so & it took him no time to reach them. I'm talking split seconds!

It was close to dark and I saw a deer walking along the edge of the clearing I was in. It kept looking into the woods like it was curious of something. The deer got closer and I took the shot. When I did, it took off running and hit some brush and fell down. I waited about 30 minutes and it got dark. I got out of my stand and went to get the deer. I got my things together and started dragging my deer to my truck that was about a quarter of a mile through a thick part of the woods I was hunting in. I was carrying my rifle, backpack, the deer, and a flashlight in my mouth. So I could pull the deer by its leg, and hold my rifle and backpack straps. After walking through the thick part of the woods, it was a straight shot to my truck. I dropped the deers leg to get situated and get myself altogether to continue my walk out, when I looked up with my light still in my mouth. I saw two eyes looking back at me. They looked wider than any animal I had ever seen at night. I have been hunting all my life. I have seen everything from deer to coyote to bear. These set of eyes were about my height, I am 5' 10\". The trail I was on slightly went down hill. It stared at me long enough for me to put my rifle and backpack down. I had a 9mm Glock with me and I pulled it out, I shot once into the ground next to me to get whatever it was to get out of the trail I was on. It did not move or flinch, it just simply looked to its left and looked back at me. I looked down to take a knee, because I was getting worried. I got on my knee, looked back up, and it walked off to it's left, into some of the thickest woods I have seen. I grabbed the deer and continued dragging it towards my truck. When I got to the spot where I thought I saw the eyes, I looked to both sides of the trail and I could smell a musky foul odor, and where it had walked off the trail, tree limbs and trees were pushed over as if something huge had just barged through the thicket. I went to my truck, cleaned the deer out there in the woods. Like another post on here that I read, I felt like I was watched the whole time I was cleaning the deer. I left the rib cage and spine of the deer I cleaned out there, along with the hide. When I came back to the same spot, the spine had been drug off about 300 yards from where I left it.

{"id":"39279","observed":"The time and date was Friday, Jan. 25th at around 5 or 10 past midnight.  I was sitting at my desk which is on the same wall as my front door, maybe 1 foot away from my front door.  I was actually playing an online game when I had to take a break and use the bathroom.  My bathroom is located on the left side of my front door down a short hall.  I got from the desk and turned to go down to the bathroom and as I crossed in front of the front door, something... I don't know what... caught my attention.  I turned to look out the window of the door which I have a habit  of doing anyway, and saw the thing.  Now mind you, all the lights were off in the house except for the monitor for the computer and the T.V.  Now, my window in the front door is probably 4 inches wide by by maybe two and a half feet tall.  Anyway, like I said, I looked out the window and saw the thing.  I call it the thing because I am still not quite sure what I saw, but, I do know for a fact what I think I saw.  I have stated before that it looked kind of like a Captain Cave man, but I guess it looked more like an over grown cousin It from the Addams Family.  It had what looked like a dark brownish to black hair everywhere, no neck that I could really tell of or see and really long arms.I couldn't really see any facial features because of all the hair.  Its hair on its body and arms meshed so well together it really did look like an over grown cousin It.  Keep in mind also that I have several street lights nearby the house and when the moon is out, even when there are clouds in the sky I can still see in the front yard pretty good so I know it wasn't a shadow, it was way to solid and it wasn't haze build up from the cold outside because I hadn't opened the door yet.  Back to the thing.  Now I stand around 5 foot 8 inches, so I figure to the bottom of my chin is real close to 5 feet.  From the bottom of my door to the ground is right at 3 feet.  It looked to me like the thing was at least up to my chin to the top of its head, so I am roughly figuring this thing was at least 8 feet tall.  My steps are 4 feet wide hand rail to hand rail, the thing was as wide as my steps.  It looked as if were bent over like it was looking in the door, but, it was standing at the bottom of the steps on the ground so I cant be sure what it was doing.  Now my desk is like I said about a foot from the door on the right side of the door, but where my monitor, keyboard and desk is is on the far side of the desk about 4 feet from the door.  Between the monitor and the door on the desk is my printer and various other stuff including my camera.  I turn my head to find my camera and grab it to maybe get a picture of the thing because I know if I tell anybody they will think I am crazy. By the time I find my camera, grab it and look back, it's gone.  I look out the window real good in the yard and turn mu porch light on and see nothing.  I slowly open the front door to get a really good look, still nothing.  It's as if this thing has vanished. So I close the door and go on to the bathroom.  When I come back and sit down I can hear what i can only describe as sounding like thunder but not nearly as loud or as long, maybe a couple or few seconds at a time.  I am the only one up at this time of the morning so no one else that I know of saw or heard anything.  I know I am not crazy and I have 20/20 eye sight. I was in the army in my younger days.  I have traveled a lot of places and seen many strange yet wonderful things, all of which have a reason for why they are, where, what or how they are.  This thing, I have never in my life ever seen anything like it before... anywhere, and I have seen hundreds of pictures between the web and that show where they hunt for big foot on Animal Planet.

There was an old car parked on the side of the road, so I could hardly see to turn left, so when I did, I drove for maybe 10-15 seconds when I saw eyes in front of me (it was about 9:15 in the PM) I turned lights on bright and I thought it was a homeless man walking along the road, but seeing someone walking down here when its dark is unlikey, I slow down ,I didn't know if it was gonna cross the road , I was driving about 35  in a 45 mph zone. As I got closer I noticed it was not a man, it was something else, like a bear walked up right with long legs and arms longer than a man, had dark hair, I couldn't really see the color very well. He was about as big as my grandfather and he is 6' 11'' . I was speechless, and my sister was scared to death because our house is 1 minute from where he was at. That night I couldn't sleep and the next morning I got up and went back there, no foot prints or anything because it is so dry here from no rain.I haven't seen it since but it's only been a few days","classification":"Class A","county":"Johnston","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.5311,"longitude":-78.4048,"latlng":"-78.4048,35.5311","dewPoint":73.43,"humidity":0.91,"cloudCover":0.75,"moonPhase":0.15,"pressure":1013.31,"weatherSummary":"Rain until afternoon.","uvIndex":7,"visibility":7.88,"highTemp":81.12,"midTemp":76.575,"lowTemp":72.03,"precipitationIntensity":0.0476,"precipitationProbability":0.8,"precipitationType":"rain","windBearing":66,"windSpeed":3.31}
{"id":"12333","timestamp":1120262400,"title":"Possible vocalization in the Blue Ridge Mountains","observed":"My buddy and I were camping on July 2, 2005, in the [Blue Ridge mountains] of western NC, several miles outside of [a mountain town].  At midnight, we were preparing to retire for the night to our respective tents, when we heard a prolonged howl which was about as far away from us as the 1994 Columbiana, OH, howl (on the BFRO website) seemed from its source.  At least, that's the best way I could determine the distance from us.  This howl was at least twice as long (I want to say even longer) as the Columbiana, OH, howl.  I'd estimate the howl we heard to be more or less ten seconds long. It was the length of the call, as much as it was the deep tone and strength of it, which attracted our immediate attention.  It just didn't seem to quit.  It wasn't interrupted, either, like if the creature took a breath and then continued.  This went on continuously for around 10 seconds. Although we only heard the one howl, it was so loud (for its distance from us) and so prolonged, and gained strength at the end instead of waning, that we were rather shaken by its magnitude .... commenting to each other that nothing human or zoological that we knew of, could possibly have made that noise. I have studied/researched Sasquatches since grad school in Idaho in the mid-1970's, even though my degree is in Literature/English.  I roamed the Rockies of the NW every chance I got for most of five years, looking for evidence, tracks, sign, sounds, anything......found zilch.  This is the first experience I have had, and even though auditory, it was exhilirating.  Both my friend and I were struck by the animal-like characteristics of this howl, and tried to think of things which might have made the sound, OTHER than a sasquatch.  No, we decided quite without hesitation, it couldn't have been a machine-made sound (like a siren) because it was too low in tone.  No, we decided, it couldn't have been fireworks, as they tend to \"scream\" and then wane, whereas this howl was low in tone and went on for a number of seconds (beyond 5 or 6 secs.) and gained momentum and strength toward the end, so we ruled fireworks out.  Since it was July 4th weekend, that's why this was a consideration.  No human could make that loud a howl for that period of time.... human lung capacity way too small, we concluded. And, on we went, trying to explain to each other the howl/sound by some origin other than a sasquatch.  He and I had been joking and talking for the past several years about perhaps encountering one, hearing one, etc., but never really expected this to happen.  When it did, we wanted to try to cover all the potentialities for the source of such a sound, and a sasquatch is all we could come up with, esp. Since I had heard the Columbiana Ohio sound on your website, and was immediately reminded of it when hearing (and replaying in my head) that sound on 7/2/05.  We went back to that same campsite a few weeks later, hoping for a \"repeat performance,\" but no such luck. We had a lab-mix retriever with us both times.  The night we heard the sound, the dog became very animated, very intently listening to that distant howl, but because it was so far away, it didn't seem too bothered by it, though it DID move off into the forest toward the direction of the howl, but soon returned.  Both the dog and we maintained something of a vigil that night, but no other indications of that critter's presence were made known to us.","classification":"Class B","county":"Jackson","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.211,"longitude":-83.007,"latlng":"-83.007,35.211","locationDetails":"I'd rather not give any more specific a location than I have given for on-line use, as we hunt in this vicinity and the fewer people who know about it, the better for the critters AND us.

{"id":"23615","observed":"The only thing about my sighting I’m not 100% sure of is the month. and distances and Heights but I feel I’m pretty close. On or around July or August of 1992 I was working at a Chinese Restaurant in town. I was supposed to be heading for work, but had made my mind up earlier that I was going to layout. So that I   wouldn’t be caught by my Grandparents and or Father for being a slacker I needed a place to hide/something to do. Well not having any money I chose a place that A. gave me cover and B. gave me a place to kick around and explore. Near where we use to live (and still near today) near the Yadkin River they use to hold Tractor pulls, singings (John Anderson sang there once before he made it big) etc. It had gone out of business quite a few years back but there were still some dilapidated buildings still standing and some bleachers. I parked my car underneath the bridges that the interstate ran across and hopped over the DO NOT ENTER signed cable barrier. I followed the dirt path that led to the remains of what was once called ‘The River Run. The path ran parallel to the river, but turned away from it roughly two hundred yards from where I hopped the cable. I reached the Remains and kicked around, I looked in the old Bathrooms (basically a Pee stall) checked under the bleachers for change or dollar bills that may still be there, of course there wasn’t any. And little did I know before I got there that a crane they had recently (couple months) been using to dig out sand from the river (for what I do not know) was still there. I of course looked it over, crawled in the cab, looked for keys etc. Well, not only was I getting BORED quickly, it was getting hot. It was a hot summer and having been indoors WORKING, like a good boy the whole summer until then, I hadn’t realized how hot it got at around 11:00 am. So I decide that there had to be a better place to chill. I headed back down dirt path. The areas that the Buildings were located were Roughly one hundred and fifty yards away from the river. As I was heading back I noticed something that appeared to be sitting on the riverbank; I first assumed it was a dog. I whistled, yelled here Boy and all that and it didn’t respond. As I got closer I realized it wasn’t a dog and felt stupid, cause there were weeds and such growing at the bank and I just figured I was Whistling for WEEDS to come to me. As I got closer and closer it appeared to be a very Unkempt, long haired hippy of a man. But the Funny thing was I could only see the Bust of him (chest to top of head) so then I just assumed it was a Bum standing on a ledge in the river looking over the bank watching me. So I kept walking, actually strutting to let this Bum know if he tried to mess with me, he was going to get his ars whipped, but good. As I kept walking and not paying any attention to the Bum a strange sensation came over me (to this day I can’t explain it) I looked up and that’s when I realized it wasn’t a bum, it was something else, what, I do not know but it wasn’t human. At this point I was roughly 50 yards away, my mind was racing and my heart was beating, here I was almost face to face with a Big foot? So I did the only rational thing I could think of at the time, I ran towards. I know that, that doesn’t seem to be the brightest thing to have done BUT in my mind and with the MILLION things running through it the one thing that didn’t go through my mind was fear, NOT one ounce. Until…I was, at this point, roughly forty yards away and the closer I got, the doubts, if any that this THING was not human was completely gone. At about some thirty yards away I took my eye of it for just and I mean JUST a split second and it was gone and that is when fear struck me. I halted quickly. I dare say now I was 25 yards away from where IT was. I was petrified, I stood there for what seemed like hours, while I was standing there it was the first time that I really had the chance to reflect on what I just saw, and all I can remember thinking was. A. Why did it look like Chewbacca from Star Wars minus the black nose? B. Why did it have very light fur almost dirty strawberry blonde? C. Why no smell, don’t they always stink? D.Why did I wuss out and get scared? I finally Talked myself out of being a big wimp and decided that if it was what I think it was I need proof. I BABY stepped looking left and right as quickly as my neck could turn the whole time I was walking to the river bank. I reached the River bank and scanned the River and River bank like my life depended on it. I roughly stood there for 15 minutes looking at the Highest point to where IT could have been standing looking over the River bank at me. I looked for tracks but all I found was sand slid into the river, I looked for hair and nothing. I even sniffed around and couldn’t smell anything but what smelt like fish. I then jumped to the highest point  to try a gauge how tall IT was. I’m 6’2 and have a reach of 7’6 and I had to bounce a little (not a hard jump) but bounce nonetheless for the tips of my fingers to be even with the River bank from the highest point IT could have possibly be standing.  I know I had to bounce at least 6 inches(any more and I’m sure I would have slid into the water, so that puts the river bank height roughly 8 feet  and I was seeing IT”S Bust so IT was (and it’s a guess) roughly 9’3 –9’5 or more . I finally climbed out of the riverbank, walked to my car peering and alert to anything jumping out, but nothing eventful happened. Got in my car drove home, no one ever asked me if I laid out of work cause no one EVEN NOTICED!!! Needless to say I never laid out of work again., well not  without a good reason.","classification":"Class A","county":"Iredell","state":"North Carolina","locationDetails":"40 east  ext 163 Cool spring exit. left on hwy 64 go under 40 and first rd on left. go roughly 1 mile or mile and 1/4 . pass over yadkin river immediate right under bridges that 40 runs over.

We had dropped off a friend, who was in the Navy, in Charleston. We were driving through North Carolina on a route past Asheville. I think we were on the 26 near Hendersonville. I had been driving for about 5 hrs, and was in the hills definitely. It was about 2-3am, and it happened very fast. A small (4-5') brown shaggy creature with a very pointed head crossed in front of the car. It's arms were swinging. I was moving fast and it was close. I hit the brakes hard, locking them up and putting the car into a skid. I just missed the thing. This jarred my two friends awake who were, of course, sleeping! I told them that I had \"just seen a Jawa walk in front of the car.\" I guess my brain just couldn't reconcile what it was seeing, so \"Jawa\" popped in. I thought it was wearing a brown robe with a hood. I chalked it up to \"seeing things\" and kept driving. But the more I go over my reaction, the more I feel it was \"really\" there. I've had deer jump out in front of my car and surprise me and I've reacted the same - by hitting the brakes with no delay. It was not like some foggy apparition slowly appearing in front of the car.

{"id":"12640","timestamp":1133481600,"title":"Possible vocalization in Great Smoky Mountain National Park","observed":"A friend and I were camping in the Big Creek Campground in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park right on the Tennessee and North Carolina border. It was dark. We just finished cleaning up after dinner and were walking to the restroom to get ready for bed.  We heard crashing and the excited snorting sound deer make when startled.  We had flashlights with us and shined them on some deer that were looking toward the forest.  There was a trail which went up the side of the mountain in the direction the deer were staring.  They turned their attention toward us for a second but then continued looking toward the trail. They ran a few feet and made some noise and stopped again to stare in the same direction.  We figured a bobcat, coyote or something scared them. Eventually the deer slowly calmed down and crept back to where they were originally browsing.  This all lasted about 5 minutes. We were walking back to the camp when out of the dark (in the direction the deer were looking) came a long call. It echoed through the woods.  We thought it sounded like a primate - some kind of monkey or ape. Eventually I stumbled on your website and read how you use gibbon calls to attract sasquatches.  I then got curious and started checking out different animal calls.  The call of a gibbon is exactly the sound we heard that night. I wish at the time we had thought it could be Bigfoot, but we didn't, so we never took off into the night to look or it or look for prints. The noise wasn't a recording.

My whole life I had always heard my family (who lived in the same general area and still does) and many neighbors talking about \"The Noise\".  That's all we ever knew it to be.  It was a very loud and spine chilling howl. I heard this myself, usually when I was out hunting, it would be around early evening just starting to get dark, id be walking back to my home to my house when id notice everything would get very quiet, then suddenly it would let out a bone chilling scream that sent me scurrying as quickly as possible to my home. I remember this noise actually frigthened my father who wasnt scared of anything. This sound happened so frequently that when i was in the woods or outside in my yard and i would hear no animals or birds i would actually brace myself and start heading to the house. I had several animals, horses, dogs and goats, My dogs including the one i deemed my guard dog would all sit in their houses and whimper before and after the scream, My horses would head towards the open pasture or head for the barn and whinny, but this was only after a few seconds of silence. the goats were usually kept in the barn due to there hoodini like escape attempts. I think the most frightening moment took place when i was in my upstairs bed room closeing my windows up for the night it was late summer going on fall, i cant exactly remember what time but it was probally around 10 at night since i remember my mother going to bed, what made this esspecially disturbing was just as soon as i closed the shade on the last window,it screamed and it sounded like it was right under my window, i ran to my moms room where she was sitting up in bed looking because she had also heard it.

The back of the hole is shallow and slow moving about 15 or 20 ft across. So we decided to fish down to the next pot hole, and as we walked beside the creek I noticed across the creek there is sort of like sand bar where the water has eroded it off to a drop off not like a flat beach. In the sand bar I noticed the sand had been walked in and the sand had fallen of in the creek like an animal had forded the creek their.  On our side of the creek the bank is very very rocky with a lot of big rocks as big as cars and smaller line the creek and the surrounding area . About 15 ft below the sand bar on our side I was walking across some of these big rocks to fish this next hole.When I looked between the rocks and saw one BIG foot print in the wet creek bank sand. I dropped down in  between the rocks to look close at it .I am convinced that is was to wide to be a man or woman's . I put my boot beside it and I wear a size 10 an a half and this was probably a 15 0r 16 and and about 2 inches wider than my boot. It had undoubtedly crossed the river from the sand bar to this spot. The other side of the creek is rock cliffs an straight up no way to explore any direction.","classification":"Class B","county":"Caldwell","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.94585,"longitude":-81.7418,"latlng":"-81.7418,35.94585","locationDetails":"Wilson Creek Gorge area , north west of Lenoir , N.C. in Caldwell county.

We were watching some lights move across Brown mountain trying to determine if they were the Brown Mountain lights (investigator's note:  apparently this is a locally known phenomenon), or just motorcycles.  At any rate it was about this time we heard the noise. We had our flash lights off cause we were watching the lights on Brown mountain, then we heard this long scream.  We stopped in our tracks and listened carefully.  The scream repeated.  It was coming from the south west of our location deep in the valley.  We hurried back up to camp and turned off the radio in the truck.  The scream continued.  Now this has been going on for a couple mins and the scream changed.  It would scream for a few seconds and then the sound would start to break up.  At the time we described it as a cackle like sound, but the newspaper article (that was found in the BFRO media files) described it as a yodeling sound, which is more accurate. This continued on for several mins, every few seconds another scream continuing on to the yodel.  Both of us are avid campers, and camp in this same area every October.  But we had never heard a sound like this before.  We first thought perhaps a mountain lion, because we had heard their cries compared to a woman in pain screaming.  We debated for a while and at last decided to move to another campsite for the night as we had not explored our surroundings much prior to nightfall.  We have yet to be back, but we have full intentions of going back and exploring the valley from which the sound came.","classification":"Class B","county":"Burke","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.83845,"longitude":-81.80479,"latlng":"-81.80479,35.83845","locationDetails":"(specific location edited per witness request)","dewPoint":43.94,"humidity":0.72,"cloudCover":0.02,"moonPhase":0.14,"pressure":1020.25,"weatherSummary":"Clear throughout the day.","uvIndex":4,"visibility":8.84,"highTemp":72.62,"midTemp":57.8,"lowTemp":42.98,"windBearing":291,"windSpeed":1.83}

First of all he told me that he had never heard of such sightings before. As my brother and I got a little older we started reading up on Bigfoot sightings and stories in books when we were still about 8 and 10 years old. Anyway, we learned that there had been sightings in the same area as my Father's after his, and he never knew anything about these reports. My Father is an avid outdoorsman and he is far from one who would fabricate something of this magnitude. All he can say to us is that he was deer hunting, in what is very remote country and still is today, and he was up on a mountain ridge. He said he saw something that at first glance he thought was a bear, but as he looked a little longer he realized that it wasn't. Keep in mind that he hadn't ever heard of Bigfoot before. I'm not sure how long the sighting lasted, but he said that it walked too far too long to be a bear. He said that it stopped and started messing with a tree limb and then turned and walked over the other ridge and never saw it again that day. He has not hunted there anymore since. His sighting happened before the others that made local news. I would also like to comment on the sighting that happened in Uwharrie National Forest. My Father, brother, and I hunt there and there is no doubt in my mind that the report made for that is true simply because there is so much remote country there. Not only on the Natl.

I have never forgotten what I saw! My sister and I have talk bout it a lot, but I have not talked to outsiders in fear of being labeled crazy, or being laughed at. It was in the fall of the year, late September 1967. My father raised tobacco in the small community called churchland, one of the many small townships in Davidson County. At that time we were renting an old homestead owned by a lawyer, who is now deceased. We lived out in the sticks, right next to the Yadkin River, which separates Davidson County from Davie County. My father was on the tractor coming from the tobacco field that evening, my older sister and some friends where on the back on the trailer that was used to haul tobacco from the field. It was dusk my father had just turned on the tractor lights. I was setting on his lap. We were almost to our tobacco barn when this huge thing stepped out in front of the tractor into the lights. It stopped right in front of us, turned toward us and paused. The face resembled a man, much lighter than the rest of him, but his body was covered in dark hair. It was taller that my dad who was around six foot and it was a lot bigger than him. Its arms were dropped past its waist. It acted like we were no threat, and turned and took a big step and it was in the woods. My dad put the brakes on, left the tractor running, left me sitting in the driver's seat and jumped off to follow it. I started crying, because I didn’t know what it was.  I even thought at that time it was the booger man that would get you if you were not good. That is what my parent’s would tell us kids. My father came back, not saying a word and took us kids back to the house. He told my mom not to let us out. He then took his coon hunting gun and left to hunt it down. He later returned that night. He could not find the thing we saw. We had to stay in the front yard after that. We later moved to a farm that my dad had purchased a few miles away from this one, still the Yadkin River, flowed right next to our farm. For years I wondered what the heck it was that we saw. Years later in the late seventies, more and more was on TV about what is now known as Bigfoot. I know without a doubt that this is what we saw that evening.","classification":"Class A","county":"Davidson","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.75,"longitude":-80.375,"latlng":"-80.375,35.75","dewPoint":20.09,"humidity":0.43,"cloudCover":0.08,"moonPhase":0.72,"pressure":1018.58,"weatherSummary":"Clear throughout the day.","uvIndex":9,"visibility":10,"highTemp":53.82,"midTemp":43.375,"lowTemp":32.93,"windBearing":234,"windSpeed":0.56}

I was in my apartment one evening in December, 2000, around 7:30 in the evening.  We were having a snow storm and it was raging outside.  Suddenly my dog, who is normally pretty laid-back unless there is something weird going on, went absolutely NUTS and tried to break through my sliding glass door, barking, clawing and growling.  She is very gentle with people and loves just about everybody, so this clued me into the fact that there was probably an animal outside, which stuck me as unusual since she has never reacted like THAT to any animal; usually she woofs a little or gives curious little whines.  My brother looked at me and said, \"What is THAT all about?\"  I told him that I thought that there was probably an animal outside and not to worry about it. At about 10:00 in the evening I took my dog out to do her business.  As soon as we got to the yard I noticed very unusual tracks in the snow.  Unfortunately, it was pretty late and the snow had been blowing for 2 1/2 hours, so I could not decifer any particular features, toes nor boot sole patterns.  All I could see were footprint indents.  They were unusual because they were so huge, deep and spread apart.  Initially I thought that my neighbor's boyfriend was probably outside earlier in the evening, but then I realized that that would be ridiculous.  For one thing, his feet aren't that large, and the prints could have been from a size 14 or 15 shoe, and why in the world would he be walking around at night in the middle of a snowstorm?  For another thing, he is not THAT tall; I put my heavy hiking boot, woman's size 9, up next to the prints and they could have swallowed my boots 2 1/2 times.  I also mimicked the gait to see if I could guess-timate about how tall the individual was.  My legs had to spread 4-5 feet apart just to keep in step with the prints.  I also noticed that there was only one set of tracks going in one direction---from a deep part of the woods, across the lawn, and over a bank and into the woods again.  I deduced from the drifts that the prints had been made within two to three hours, exactly the same time my dog went nuts earlier in the evening.  I could have kicked myself for not checking it out when it happened.","classification":"Class B","county":"Henderson","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.36,"longitude":-82.4831,"latlng":"-82.4831,35.36","locationDetails":"My apartment complex is located on the side of a small mountain in Henderson county, on the outskirts of Hendersonville.

{"id":"50721","observed":"I am a BFRO investigator in the mountains of Western North Carolina. Having lived in the mountains all of my life, I have enjoyed hunting, hiking and mountain things since I was a boy. So, I am very comfortable with being in the woods and for years have taken late night drives to see wildlife. For the past few years, I have been taking late night drives to my research are on good weather nights. It was Tuesday June 23rd, 2015; the weather was good and I decided to take a late drive to my research area. I was still on the main road taking my time and within 5 miles of my destination. I was not really thinking about Sasquatch but just enjoying the late night drive and some music.  As I was rounding a slight turn on the road, I saw a coyote on the right side of the road. I slowed slightly as my eyes panned back to the road and I then saw to my left the creature just off the road and behind the guardrail. My trucks side lights hit it just briefly where I could get a good look at it. My sighting was brief but I did get a good look at it. I could not believe what I saw! I went up the road and turned around as it caught me off guard I did not think to stop.  I was trying to talk myself out of what I saw. \"Could it been something else?\" The area on the left was very green so I thought I might have seen something else, maybe. As I approached the area I stopped and searched up and down for anything looking reddish/brown in color. Since it was June in the Mtns., everything was very green but nothing was brown at all. Bringing proof to me that it was a creature I saw.  It is very hard to describe the feeling I had at the time of the sighting and after. I was feeling very strange and could not believe what had just happened. This is what I saw.  Just past the guardrail and slightly off the bank of the road (this bank is very steep) I saw a reddish/brown upright figure. It had it's back to me and I could see from the back and upper legs behind the guardrail. I am very sure it was on two legs with a most impressive width. The shoulders were very large and the head was slightly forward with a no neck type look.  The waist to shoulders made a very impressive \"V\" shape larger than any man I have ever seen. The hair was slightly long and had another color of gray/white underneath it with a main coat color of reddish/brown. Some of the back hair was shaggy looking. The left shoulder was slightly up and the arm was curled. The sighting was brief but I got a very good look at it. I could tell it was very tall. I did a sketch. After turning around and checking the sighting area from my truck, I pulled off about 150 yards below on the side of the road.  I got out of my truck to listen for about 10 minutes and then did a \"Howl Call\". I immediately got a response from a pack of coyotes. They were very close and below the road about 150 yards away. (This would be the side of the road the creature was on.) I tried driving back up the road to see anything and about 100 yards above where I saw the creature I saw a Wild Boar feeding on the side of the road. Later on I stopped at an overlook about 1/4 mile past the sighting and made another \"howl call\". I got an immediate response from an owl behind me close to the parking lot. Then just after this response I heard another owl call in the valley below me towards the sighting area. It was the loudest owl call I have ever heard! I have heard many different owl calls but this one was very strange. The volume of it was very strange and loud. I stayed in the area for 4 more hours with nothing more happening.  The next afternoon me and friend went back to the general area of the sighting and looked for tracks. We could only see disturbances as the ground was very rocky, steep and hard. I cannot fully explain my feeling after the sighting. I really noticed I was feeling strange when I had gone to get a drink a few miles away in a store. I notice I was sweating and feeling very odd. I think that I was slightly in a state of shock. I feel like this was due to me seeing something I had not seen ever before and something that was hard for me to process. I have been hunting and in the woods all of my life. I have seen every animal in our area in many situations. Trust me, I have never seen anything like this before. Important footnote:  This sighting happened just within about 6-7 miles from another reported incident that I investigated. BFRO report 49148 happened on June 29th, 2015; 6 days after the sighting I had. I feel like this is more than a coincidence.","classification":"Class A","county":"Macon","state":"North Carolina","locationDetails":"Please do not post"}
{"id":"49148","timestamp":1435536000,"title":"Appalachian Trail Hikers find possible tracks and hear a late night howl near Franklin","observed":"Shortly after laying down for the night during a backpacking trip in the Nantahala Wilderness, we heard a howl that lasted 10-15 seconds, with a change of tone for the last few seconds. This howl could not have been mistaken for any other animal and sounded very similar to recordings of other howls. In the next 2 hours we both heard random whoops also.  The next day while hiking we came across several very interesting signs along the trail. The first was spotting what looked like a game trail that crossed the hiking trail. Upon closer inspection, the tracks in the well traveled trail clearly were not made by bear or any other four legged animal.  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen.  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches.   The ferns and weeds in the trail that had been pressed down were still green and flat which made me think the tracks had been made within the past couple of days. I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions.  After traveling the hiking trail further down the ridgeline for close to mile I spotted another trail that crossed the hiking trail. The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail. I took pictures to gauge the depth and length of the prints.  I found a stick on this trail that had blood on it.  I regret not keeping it for evidence to see what type of blood it was.  The location of both trails had some similarities: both were located in gaps along the ridgeline and there was an unusually high amount of limbs and trees wedged in tree forks at both sites.  One other strange observation made along the trail was finding 3 large white mushrooms placed upside down near the trails.

{"id":"13663","timestamp":626745600,"title":"Daylight sighting by hunters near Windsor","observed":"Early in the fall in 89 my uncle and myself were hunting deer in the Cashi River Swamp, a few miles from his home.  We were being very quiet and moving slowly trying to get a good look at a spot were deer often cross the creek. Reaching a spot were we could see the crossing I suggested we hide behind a stump that we could see about 50 yards away. My uncle had hunted at that crossing a few times before. He said he never noticed that stump before. Before we could discuss it further the stump moved into a sort of crouching position. This gave me the impression that it might be a bear. I almost fired when it stood to full height. It shook its shoulders and stretched with its arms raised above its head, almost like a human waking from a nap. Through the scope of my rifle I could see its face briefly. It was more apelike than human with deep set brown eyes and a heavy brow ridge. The nose was flat to the face and the lips were very thin and general skin tone was dark. It was covered in long brown to black hair. It was matted in places but flowing in others. We watched it for approx 10 min. as it moved up and down the creek. My uncle had had enough and decided we needed to be going. We were backing away from the area when I stepped under a low tree branch and it knocked my hat from my head. Right afterward we heard a low growl coming from its direction. My uncle got nervous and worked the lever action of his rifle but did not shoot.  We saw it through back its head and scream one time. It was like a woman and a bobcat screaming at the same time. It then started running, and cleared a 10 foot creek in one leap. Both of our nerves were pretty well shot by this time so we left the swamp. Talking about it on the way home we decided to go back the next day with a couple of dogs. When we got to within of 200 yards of the deer crossing the dogs began to whine and tried to back away, we joind them. That night a hard rain fell and that entire bottom was covered in about two inches of water.","classification":"Class A","county":"Bertie","state":"North Carolina","latitude":35.998,"longitude":-76.946,"latlng":"-76.946,35.998","locationDetails":"It was near Republican Baptist Church in Burtie County, North Carolina.

The park rangers tried to explain them as rabbits or small animals jumping up out of the snow and back in again.

{"id":"12562","timestamp":1125100800,"title":"Multiple witness sighting near White Shield","observed":"On Aug 26 around 2:20-2:30am my two cousins were driving back from Minot, they took the back roads to get home faster. They were about 2-3 miles from home on Counrty Road 7 when they said that they were just talking and notice on the left side in the North bound lane a large brown hairy 7-8ft tall thing was standing there, they said they were going about 50-55mph and slowed down a bit, as they passed by it they taped on the brake and in the brake lights they saw it and punched it back home, they said they were so scared that they were going aleast 90mph to get back. As they got to one of my cousins house they went and wroke my Uncle up and told him that they saw big foot. Then they drove to my house and wroke me up, so i said them \"yeah right like you seen a big foot around here\". They were both scared and shaking so thats when i knew that they saw something, so I took two spotlights a 5 million and a 3.5 million, my Uncle had a 1 million light also. We asked them to show us, in which they were both agreed after the calmed down a bit. we left there car and took my Aunts van and headed north, they showed us the spot and i marked by throwing out a full water bottle and I asked them which way do you think it was going and if they seen more, she said that \"it might of been moving West\", so we headed West bound on Country Rd. 6 just North of White Shield as we headed about 1-2miles west from Country Rd. 7 we turned North bound on Country Rd. 5 as we were spotlighting in the cut Wheat Fields. I was on the passenger side and my Uncle was driving we were both looking around with the lights when I picked up a bright RED reflection of eyes, as i told my Uncle to stop i notice that this thing was on all fours  moving west towards us and then it stop and what looked like it sat down, i mean it looked like a gorrilla from the movies. As we stoped and sat there we must of been watching it for about 3-5mins, It seemed unreal to me but as i started to realize that this is happing and that we don't have gorrilla's in North Dakota that is when my Uncle notice two more sets of eyes behind the one we were watching, my cousins started screaming and cussing at us to leave and to get the Cops and Game & Fish, so after that we started to turn around and head back in i noticed it stood up that's when i said hurry up lets get Game & Fish out here. When i arrived at my house my cousin called the BIA and they said they will contact the Game Warden. My Uncle and I told my cousin to tell them that we are going to go back out there and wait for the Game Warden, my cousins stayed. My cousin husband wanted to go with us. As we started to turn on country Rd. 5 thats when we noticed the smell of pee and old sweet and slew odor, it wasn't us because i checked the smell inside that van and it smelled better then the  outside. We stoped and jumped out and started to listen, thats when we noticed the truck lights on Country Rd. 6 it was the Game Warden. We flashed him down and talked to him and gave all the info so he said he will check the field out and left moving East with all his spotlights on. As we talked my Uncle said \"try to call it\" so my cousin husband made a howling sound and sure enough another sound came back a faint bellow South West of us about 1/2-1mi. There is no cattle around there so we started to head in that direction and stoped where we thought the sound was at. we had the windows down and started to listen for any sound, there was none not even crickets or birds or grasshoppers chirping so we turned around and left, stoped Game Warden and we stated looking untill 7am that morning, we noticed that there were lots of slew and deep weeds a place for a good hiding spot. On the next day we started looking for prints and we found some impressions in the cut wheat field and ditch, the prints were close to 15 1/5 inches and about 5 1/2 - 6 inches wide. We stoped a BIA officer and told him that we found some imprssions so he came out there and took some pictures, the foot prints pointed in a East direction as we started to track them we found 3 other sets that seemed like they were zigziging around, after an 30min or so we track it to a tree row where it seemed that there were spots of cut hay put into piles and pine tree branches 2in thick snaped off, the sap still ozzing out from the break, and sunflower or tall weeds stems in that spot, there was no tall weeds around that spot, so we walked around and found a slew just at the end of the tree row about 200yards away, had the same stems from the weeds. On the 31st of Aug my Uncle and I kinda made a path of direction, it looks like they follow slews and small ponds maybe for drinking water. The direction was taking them to Lake Sakakawea, has we tested taht theory we were West of White Shield when we heard a low scream, a dog that lived at a farm house started to bark. Where the spot we seen it and to the location where we heard it, are theory was correct. On Sept 4 since we left them alone for a couple of days we went to the spot where we thought the would be at.. NO Luck they weren't there so that was the end of the search or hunt, until Sept 9 when 6 kids saw a tall black thing running on two legs heading West on BIA 1 just 1/2mi North of White Shield, I talked to the kids and the said when it was running in the field it was black and on two legs and as it crossed the road it took 3 steps and it was on the other side. This was around 9pm and the sun was setting. By the time the kids told it was dark, my Uncle and I drove back there and found nothing, the next day Sept 10 we tried to find the path where this thing or big foot crossed, we are still looking for signs or even better prints.

{"id":"7809","timestamp":1104969600,"title":"Teen has nighttime sighting near Fontenelle Forest","observed":"The following occured in 1975 when I was 14 years old.  My family lived in Bellevue, Nebraska (near Offutt Air Force Base) where my father had recently retired from the U.S. Air Force after 24 years of active duty.  I now live in Florida. Actually, this incident was a series of three encounters over a three-day period.  A bit of background seems necessary.  My girlfriend lived on the next block.  Our houses were separated by a field with a stand of trees on the north side of the field; the stand of trees was approximately 20 feet wide at that time and ran East-West.  The stand of trees ran to the East to Bellevue Blvd.  On the East side of Bellevue Blvd. was a heavely forested area that was either a part of, or bordered, Fontenelle Forest.  I would go over to my girlfriend's  house and visit until it was time for me to go back home (my curfew was 10:00 pm during the summer). The first incident occurred as I was crossing the field on my way home around 10:00 p.m.  I was walking in a NW direction with the thick stand of trees to my right.  I heard heavy foot-falls and occasional snapping of branchs within the stand of trees.  Whatever it was within the trees was paralleling me.  When I stopped, it stopped.  When I began walking again, it began walking.  It was very dark in the field and I could not see anything.  After several stops and starts, I became somewhat frightened and ran the rest of the way across the field, climbed over the 4-foot chainlink fence that surrounded our backyard, and ran up our backyard (it was basically a hill) and into the house. The second incident happened the very next night.  This occurrence happened exactly the same way as the first incident. The final incident happened on the third night.  As I crossed the field I again heard the heavy foot-falls and snapping of small branches within the stand of trees.  However, this time I was not being paralled; the thing was heading in a SW direction which placed it on an intercept course to my NW direction of travel.  I could hear it getting closer, but could not see anything because of the extreme darkness.  Near the point of interception, I began to smell a foul odor.  The odor was very stong and almost made me gag.  By now the foot-falls were very near.  I could feel the thing cross in front of me very close, but could not see anything.  The foot-falls were now on my left.  At this point I became extremely scared and began running across the field.  I'm not sure, but I suspect I cleared our 4-foot fence without even touching it. About half-way up the hill (our backyard) I stopped.  I can't explain why I did this, but I simply felt compelled to do so.  I turned around and saw what had crossed my path.  The backyard and a portion of the field was nicely illuminated by a flood-light my father had put on the back of the house. Standing at the edge of the field next to a clothes-line pole, was a creature on two legs.  It was covered in dark brown hair.  I estimate the height at 7 feet.  This is based on the fact that the clothes-line pole was 6 feet in height and the creature's head was a good foot above the top of the pole.  I was approximately 40-50 feet from it, but could not make out any facial features.  I recall that there was eye-shine, but I can't recall the color, possibly reddish.  The thing was extremely thick across the chest.  The arms hung almost to the knees.  This thing was very muscular.  We stood there staring at each other for approximately 20 seconds before I turned and ran into my house (I chickened out before it did). There is no question in mind that what I saw was a bigfoot.","classification":"Class A","county":"Sarpy","state":"Nebraska","latitude":41.134,"longitude":-95.88,"latlng":"-95.88,41.134","locationDetails":"Georgia Ave. and Tulip Ln. run East-West  My house was approximately 1/3 of a mile from Bellevue Blvd., which ran along the heavily forested area of Fontenelle Forest.","dewPoint":2.79,"humidity":0.89,"cloudCover":0.37,"moonPhase":0.86,"pressure":1020.35,"weatherSummary":"Overcast starting in the evening.","uvIndex":2,"visibility":7.44,"highTemp":12.83,"midTemp":8.475,"lowTemp":4.12,"precipitationIntensity":0.0006,"precipitationProbability":0.29,"precipitationType":"snow","windBearing":222,"windSpeed":2.25}
